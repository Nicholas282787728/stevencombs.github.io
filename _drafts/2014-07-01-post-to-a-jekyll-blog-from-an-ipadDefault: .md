In an [earlier post][1], I spent some time discussing why I moved from [Blogger](!g) to a [Jekyll blog](!g) hosted on [GitHub](!g). One of the negatives of the move I identified was the inability to post to my blog from an iPad. The reason is that there is no way currently to manage a GitHub repository on an iOS device.

Solutions others recommend include, [waiting until you get home][2], [using a remote connection][3] to a Mac and an iPhone only app, [Octopage](!itu). Until Octopage releases an iPad version, I am not interested. I also think the option I present may even be a better solution as it includes the wonderful iOS text editor [Editorial](!itu). Let's get to it.

While my solution doesn't require Editorial, its use makes the workflow much easier. I am a relatively new user of GitHub and what some may already know, I recently discovered. You can add files to a GitHub repository using a web browser. Seems GitHub includes a rudimentary edit window that you can use to create code or text files.

In Editorial, I created a bookmark to my blog's GitHub `_posts` online directory as shown in the image below.

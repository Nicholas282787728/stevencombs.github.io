## Sort

## Search
Saved searches

## Reminders
Reminders can be sent from Evernote daily and Evernote also notifies you of tasks that need attention

## Delegate
You can share a note to delegate

## Completion
At the completion of Tasks, you have two options, archive or delete. For individual tasks, I generally delete. I've never been one to reference completed tasks. Some like to maintain a history. The easiest way would be to check the item as completed as shown in the image below and do nothing else.

This will remove the task from your list, but not delete from your notebook. If that works for you and you don't mind these complete tasks archived in your main task notebook, that's all you need to do. Another way to archive would be to create a new notebooks (!Tasks Archive) and simply move completed tasks to that notebook. If you are like me and don't archive your tasks; trash them! Couldn't be simplier.

Tasks that included additional content such as articles, sound files, office documents, can easily be turned into a regular note and be archived for later reference.

# Projects
I consider a project a task that requires multiple steps. My system facilitates the conversion of a single task into a project. Convert a task to a project by simply adding a checklist of tasks necessary to complete the project as shown in the image below.

You can also share your project with other Evernote users or as a online web page using the *Share* feature. This works nicely for smaller projects, but larger projects may require more granularity.

For larger projects, create a new notebook named as the short title of the project. Then create individual notes for each task, as we do with our main task list. If a project task requires a delegate, share each individual task with the delegates.

Manage the project tasks in the same way we manage tasks from our main task list.

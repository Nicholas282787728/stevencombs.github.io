I'm continuing my series of post documenting my experience with my new Creality Ender-3 3D printer. In this post, I will share my selection for a 3D printer table as well as the enhancements I made.

# It begins with this IKEA furniture
I knew my search would begin at IKEA. Price was a consideration as was something with a modern design. I went into the store assuming I would find what I was looking for in office furniture department. As with most visits at IKEA you are forced to walk through many other departments before reaching the one you really need. In my case, I walked through Kitchens.

I'm often asked what gadgets we use on a regular basis. This post will list those devices and also provide a bit of information about their use. This is a live list that I will update regularly. If you have questions about any device, please leave a comment below.

| Gadgets     | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| iPhone 5s   | This is Nikki's phone. She uses the phone on the Virgin Mobile network to keep the cost of her plan to $30 monthly.                                                                                   |
| Nexus 6     | My primary phone that runs Android Lollipop 5.1.1. I use this phone on the Google Project Fi network. Project Fi has a unique pricing structure and I rarely spend more than $28/month for my service |
| iPad Air    | The iPad Air is my primary tablet. Since purchasing the large screen Nexus 6, I find myself using the iPad Air less and less. Still, for long form reading, it is the best device                     |
| iPad 2      | Nikki has used her iPad 2 for several years now. She uses it to read ebooks, scan her work email and play a few casual games. She's not asked for an upgrade and she's not had a single complaint.    |
| Amazon Echo | I've already written much about the [Amazon Echo][d44d8a3d]. Suffice it to say, we are both fans of the Echo and it provides us with information, music and home automation control.                  |

| 50 inch Sony Television | This television is in our bedroom and contains several devices. It is roughly 5 years old and was one of the first so called, "smart televisions." We no longer use any of the smart television features. Instead we have several devices connected to the television. |

| Yamaha Sound Bar | Beneath our television sits a 2009 era Yamaha sound bar. This thing is amazing and still sounds great. The Yamaha setup configures the soundbar to match your room layout. The speakers inside the soundbar actually move! |

| Sony Subwoofer | To add more punch to our sound, a 2005 era Sony 100 watt subwoofer connects to the Yamaha sound bar. Together, the two provide amazing surround without the need for rear speakers. |

| Amazon Fire TV | Our Fire TV is connected to the television in our bedroom. We use it to view Amazon Prime, Netflix, Plex and Sling TV content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Chromecast  | This device is also connected to our bedroom television and is often used to mirror content from my Nexus 6 or from the YouTube apps on our iOS devices. |

| TiVo HD | Our TiVo HD serves a single purpose, to DVR our local programming. We have the basic Comcast plan that includes only local cable channels, high speed internet and HBO (didn't ask for it, but have it anyway). If we lived in an area were I could mount an aerial antenna or an indoor antenna would capture all the network stations, I would get rid of cable all together. |

| Mac mini    | The last device connected to our bedroom television is a Mac mini. We don't view content from the Mac mini, but use it as a Plex server to stream our ripped DVDs to the televisions in our home and our mobile devices. It also hosts an Apple Server and iSyncr to sync our iTunes library to my Nexus 6. |

| Logitech Harmony Home Hub | To control all this gadget madness in our living room, we use the Harmony remote and home hub. It allows us to press one button and have all devices turn on and ready to go. |

| 42 inch Vizio Television | This is the primary screen in our living room and is mounted above our fireplace. It's a great television that is very thin. It too has smart features, but again, we never use them in favor of a more modern device. |

| Amazon Fire TV Stick | This is only device connected to the television in our living room. We also use it to view Amazon Prime, Netflix, Plex and Sling TV content. The television in our living room is not connected to cable. |

| Kindle Fire HD | Honestly, if you use Amazon Fire devices, you need a Kindle Fire for the outstanding X-ray view alone. While watching a show on Amazon Prime, the Fire HD presents information about the movie, actors and even trivia. |

| 2008 27 inch iMac | We've had this Mac for quite some time and it is my goto mac for blogging at home, grading, and research. In 2012 it received a RAM and SSD upgrade to extend its life. It is a workhorse and an amazing value. |

| 2014 Mac mini | Early this year it was time for Nikki to upgrade her home computer. We choose a 2014 Mac mini with 8Gb of RAM and a 256Gb SSD. On this computer she uses two Viewsonic 27 inch monitors. |

| 2015 Macbook | My earlier 11 inch 2012 MacBook Air didn't last too long. At the time, I purchased it, I only included 2Gb of RAM. That quickly made this Mac obsolete for my use. I sold it and then saved for a new 2015 MacBook. It is the best laptop I've ever owned. |

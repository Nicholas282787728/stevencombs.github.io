You’ve read my path to an [Evernote Task Management system](http://www.stevencombs.com/evernote/2015/01/24/my-evernote-task-management-journey.html) and you are now ready to replicate my system. Before we begin, you need to download the free Evernote Mac software. This post will describe that process. Evernote veterans can skip this post and move on to the next in the series.

> Note: While I document the entire setup process using the Mac version of Evernote, Windows users will also be able to follow along. Especially if you use Evernote currently.

Let’s download Evernote.

# Download
The Mac version of Evernote is available from two sources:

1. [Direct download](https://evernote.com/download/)
2. [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id406056744?mt=12)

If you don’t have Evernote installed, download a copy from one of the two locations using the links I provide above. I recommend you use the Mac App Store link if you are new to the Mac and the direct download for more seasoned Mac users who want the latest and greatest Evernote updates before they arrive on the Mac App Store.

The Evernote application alone won’t get us anywhere. We also need a free Evernote account.

# Create Evernote account
Load the Evernote application on the Mac. When Evernote starts, it will ask for an account. Create one within the application as shown in the image below.

Alternatively, you can do this [online](https://evernote.com/) as shown in the image below; however, it will add steps so I recommend doing this within the Mac Evernote application.

After you create an account within the application, the Evernote application will start and display the default screen shown below.

Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a free Evernote account. Its time to put it to use.

# Evernote time
In the center of the application, you will find a *Welcome to Evernote* tips list. If you have not used Evernote, click each section and work through the information. 

As you click the headings, tooltips appear as demonstrated in the next image. Read each tip. The information will help you recreate the Evernote Task Management System (ETMS). Once you’ve worked through each *Explore Evernote* section, click the x, as highlighted in the image below, to close the tips area.

What remains is the single *Welcome to Evernote* note filed in the *First Notebook* notebook. Feel free to read the welcome note, but don’t try and delete it. We will use this note.

That’s it, the Evernote application is installed, your account is created and Evernote is ready to rock’n roll. You are now ready to setup up the ETMS. We will start this process in the next post. For now, take some time to learn more about Evernote by reading Evernote’s own [getting started guide](https://evernote.com/evernote/guide/mac/). It a great site packed with video and annotated images.

In a [previous post](http://www.stevencombs.com/evernote/2015/01/24/my-evernote-task-management-journey.html), I discussed my path toward an Evernote task management system. At the completion of that post, I mentioned that I would share my system. I began looking at how I would do this over the weekend.

As I prepared an outline for a single post, I realized this would be entirely unwieldy. The length was sure to deter individuals from reading in a single sitting. Additionally, those who would choose not to replicate my system entirely might have interest in bits and pieces of the system. Breaking the presentation into chunks will allow readers to pick and choose areas of interest. This step-by-step approach will also make it easier to build your own system and understand its use.

One thing I want to reiterate as shared in my previous post, is that task management systems are very personal. I don’t subscribe to the belief that my, or anyone else's, system is the best and will work for everyone. I highly anticipate that if you give my system a try, you will modify it to match your own workflow. My hope is that readers will add additional features and workflow ideas in the comments area after each post. Let’s grow this thing together and make it even better and more customizable.

This will be an eight-part series and will include the following posts (titles in blue represent posts available):

1. [**Path towards an Evernote Task Management System**](http://www.stevencombs.com/evernote/2015/01/24/my-evernote-task-management-journey.html): The long and sordid story behind my move to use Evernote as my primary task management system after trying just about everything else available on the Mac platform.
2. **Evernote Task Management – Setup**: This is the post where I share the configuration of an Evernote notebook into a mighty powerful task management system.
3. **Evernote Task Management - Task Creation**: A task management system is of no use if we can’t create tasks. This post will describe the many ways you can add tasks to my Evernote task management system.
4. **Evernote Task Management – Task Review**: Any good task management system includes task review as part of the process; however, if you have a long list of tasks, this can become difficult. This post will show you the tools available within Evernote to make this task easy and effective.
5. **Evernote Task Management – Task Completion**: What you do with a task after it has been completed is the topic of this post. You might be surprised by the things you need to consider.
6. **Evernote Task Management – Scenarios**: With the Evernote task management system in place, this post shares several scenarios to demonstrate the use of the system.
7. **Evernote Task Management – Paper**: I still like paper and I still like to print a listing of my task list. This post shares how I integrate paper into my system for those of you who still like to put your hands on your task list.
8. **Evernote Task Management – Enhancements**: As is, my Evernote task management system is pretty useful; however, with some additional software and a little bit of work, you can turn it into a powerhouse of productivity.

I’m looking forward to the series and this is the first time since [my AutoCAD publishing days](http://www.amazon.com/Steven-B.-Combs/e/B001H6NAW6/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1) that I’ve pushed myself to create such detailed oriented instructions. Unlike my days and an AutoCAD author, I won’t have the benefit of an editor or technical editor. If you find errors, please let me know via the comments or feel free to send them to me at:

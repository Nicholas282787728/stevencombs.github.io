I’ve created an enhancements page to document features added that go beyond the use of the Evernote app and services.

## Enhance with TextExpander
created a text expander snippet to make creation easier - download mine here

Code: %filltext:name=Subject% !%Y/%m/%filltext:name=day:default=28:width=2% @Tasks #task #%fillpopup:name=type:ivytech:personal% #%filltext:name=tags%

IFTT integration: see recipe in IF
AppleScript
Services
Evernote Web Clipper

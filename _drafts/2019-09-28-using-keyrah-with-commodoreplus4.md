I'm working on a project to restore a Commodore Plus/4 computer. Part of the process uses a Keyrah Commodore keyboard to USB device adapter. Not familiar with that device? Check out the link below:

[Keyrah Keyboard](http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/Keyrah_V2)

The website states the device is compatible with the Commodore Plus/4 and many other Commodore computers and while there is an abundance of information that describes how to use the device with a Commodore C64 and Amiga computers, I could find nothing specifically for the Plus/4. After some trial and error, I think I can now document the steps to use the Keyrah with the Plus/4.

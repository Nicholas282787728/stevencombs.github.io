I mentioned in my [last post][printer-setup] that my new Creality Ender-3 3D printer build surface was warped. I blame myself because when I removed fresh prints, I would often bend the build surface lightly to remove the new print. I learned quickly, DON'T DO THAT, STUPID! Because my build surface now seem irreparably damaged, I ordered the one below for around $20.

[Creality Upgraded 3D Printer Platform Heated Bed Build Surface Glass Plate][build-surface]

This post shares my experience replacing the old build surface with the one above.

# Research
I looked at several options to replace the warped build surface. The build surface included originally with the Ender-3 as made of plastic. 

![The original plastic bed][plastic-bed-flipped]

I still don't understand how the material warped. The first three prints were perfect. However, I know it is warped because there is cupping in the middle causing the center of the build surface to be further away from the print head than the corners of the build surface above the adjustment springs. This is a problem because I cannot get the first layer of any print to stick. If I moved my prints from the center of the build surface to one of the quadrants above the adjustment springs, I could coax a print but that won't work for larger prints and is just not optimal.

Online, almost everyone recommends a glass surface. Off I went researching glass build surfaces. Glass comes with some challenges itself. Many recommend that you have to first coat the build surface in hair spray or glue stick to make the first layer print. That doesn't seem like something I want to keep fooling with for each print and I can only imaging the clean up afterward. Another option is to put down painter's tape. A better solution and one to keep in mind later.

What I thought would be the perfect solution is for a glass plate to have the texture of the original build surface (see image below); which worked well before the warp incident.

After a bit more research, I discovered that Creality produces what I was looking for in an item called their [Creality Upgraded 3D Printer Platform Heated Bed Build Surface Glass Plate][build-surface]. That's a mouthful, but seemed to be what I was looking for; however, reviews were a bit mixed. Some said this was the best build surface since sliced bed (although I wouldn't recommend sliced bread as a build surface), others stated they had issues with longevity, while others didn't seem to know what they were doing in the first place. Overall, it was a four-star review. My minimum rating for a purchase. Add to cart, proceed to checkout, and ordered!

# Arrival
I used the Amazon postponed shipping feature and had the item delivered several days later since I was going to be out of town. It arrived in a nicely packaged box as shown below.

I opened it up and the build surface was suitably protected for shipping as shown below.

I peeled the protective coating off of the glass plate which felt heavy and substantial in my hand. The top of the plate included a surface texture designed to make the filament stick as shown below.

Next step was to replace the old build surface with this new one.

I also just noticed something. My plate is not screened with the same logo found on the [Amazon page][amazon-link]. Wonder what, if anything, that means for quality.

# Installation
Installation should be super easy. Remove the binder clips. Remove the old build surface. Replace with new build surface. Replace binder clips. Houston, we have a problem! The new glass plate is thicker than the original plate and the binder clips no longer fit and I don't have any larger binder clips laying around. Really, Creality? You couldn't include 25¢ clips with the $20 glass plate that probably cost $5?

Okay, need to figure out how I can use this build surface. One of the great things about owning a 3D printer is that you can print what you don't have.

# Printing new clips

Found a [surface build clip][clip] on [Thingiverse][thingiverse] by [Jonesey44][jonesey] that is supposed to be designed for the glass build service I have. Loaded up and made three copies in Cura. When done, I should have four working clips. I'm printing them now. Will take about 30 minutes at normal quality.

![Printing the four clips from Thingiverse][clips-prints]

You are probably asking how I am printing if I don't have clips. I'm using the original bed surface using the tip above (printing on a corner).

Clips are done and now it is time to give them a try. 

![New printed clips on the glass build surface][clips-done]

I backed the levelers WAY down since the glass surface is much thicker than the original build surface. Next I homed the print head. I had to be very careful to ensure the print head had enough clearance on all corners of the build surface before I began leveling so I moved it slowly to all four corners first and then returned to my original front-left corner to begin leveling. Leveling seems perfect and there doesn't appear to be any issue with the center of the plate. Looks like we might have a winner here.

With the bed level, I am ready to try out my new glass build surface.

> Note to self: I wonder how well these clips will hold up on the bed once heated. Will they lose their grip over time? The first time? I don't believe they will be a long term solution.

# First use
I decided to print a part I actually need for a retro computer project I'm working on; the restoration of a Commodore VIC-20. The keyboard has several broken keyboard plungers. I'll print a single one to test the bed and the plunger 3D file. PLA and bed all warmed up. Here we go.

First problem. Print head hit the front-right clip while homing and actually made a divot in the clip. Maybe I should just let it do that a few more times and it will carve out a nice channel.

Print began dead center on the build surface and everything on the base layer seems to be sticking well on this is rather small and complicated print. So far so good. Be back in 20 minutes.

# Remove the print
The print is complete and it looks great!

![The first print on the new build surface][print-complete]

It adhered well to the bed and I can tell as the bed is cooling, the material is releasing. As suspected, when it cooled to around 45°, the model simply popped off and it was even easier to remove than any model printed on the original bed.

# Short term review
For now, I would rate the [Creality Upgraded 3D Printer Platform Heated Bed Build Surface Glass Plate][build-surface] a winner:

## Pros
Here's what makes the glass build surface a must buy:

* inexpensive
* packed well
* looks good
* includes texture to help parts stick
* includes the Creality logo on the surface so it looks stock
* easy to install
* easy to level
* not cupped in the center
* VERY easy to remove print once surface cooled down to around 45°

## Cons
Here's what might be a draw back, but in my case, not enough to not recommend (was that a double negative?):

* other's might think it was a bit pricey since you can get a piece of glass cheaper
* original binder clips don't work due to thickness of glass plate
* no alternative clips provided

# Long term review
I will post a long term review at a later date; probably in a month or so. I'll be sure to add an item in Todoist to make sure I come back to this.

# Summary
In short, if you are still using the original Creality build surface and it is working, don't buy this upgrade. If you've been using the original build surface and it's either cupping in the middle or not allowing items to stick, in the short term, I highly recommend this build plate. Time will tell if I continue to recommend and I'm hoping I don't have to come back and modify this original and glowing review.

title: Use Gist to archive and share code snippets

This is a short, but sweet, tip for those new to coding (CSS, HTML, Python, Javascript, Ruby, etc). Lately, I’ve been working to reactivate my dormant coding skills. As I complete projects and tutorials, I often like to save my code, or snippets of the code, for future reference.

To quickly access my code snippets, I use [GitHub’s Gist service](http://gist.github.com). Where GitHub is used for larger coding projects (this blog is hosted on GitHub pages), Gist is the perfect tool to capture and share simple code snippets or projects.

Gist provides tools to archive and share your code snippets either as a link or as an embedded object. As an example, below is a Gist that I have embedded within this blog post.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/stevencombs/6477376.js"></script>

As you can see, this embedded Gist includes language based color coding, to make the code easier to read, and code numbering, to make the code easier to reference. Both tools are beneficial for anyone teaching and/or sharing almost any code language. Snippets are created by simply copying and pasting the code snippet into a formfield, selecting the code language and hitting submit. After the code is published, you share the code by copying a small script that you can include in a blog post (see below) or share the URL to the script page to share in an email, text or other electronic commmunication.

If you have a Gist account and you have some code to share, drop a comment and a link in the comments.

Bonus Geek Tip: If you use Textmate 2, install the wonderful Gist bundle. I use this bundle exclusively to manage my Gist snippets. GistBox is another Gist client you should check out; especially if you are a Chrome user.

I often "brag" to family, friends and colleagues that I have reached inbox zero. This is not to bring attention to myself but rather to inspire others to share in my joy of having a tamed inbox. Unfortunately, my boasting was not helpful. I simply showed in my social media posts that it could be done. I never shared how it is done; until now. I hope that others will spend time understanding my process and use it to create their own. See what I wrote there? That's right. The steps I list below may not work for everyone (but it might for some); however, I hope to inspire you to develop your own process.

Below are the seven steps I use to reach inbox zero:

## Step 1: Unsubscribe to EVERYTHING

The first step is to remove the noise from your inbox. Do you really need email arriving from stores you rarely shop and, should you really be getting them delivered to your work account? Do you really need to know when the next conference is for an organization you stopped paying dues to years ago? And what about those daily political messages? Nope, you don't need those either. Time to unsubscribe to EVERY email list you are on except those you reguarly act on. Notice I said act on, not read. What does that mean? Unless you would set an appointment, reply, or "actively read (not review and delete)" the email, remove your address from their bulk list.

Look in the email for an unsuscribe link; most of the time these links are at the bottom of the message so you can't easily fnd them (like the one shown below).

For reputable organizations, these links do work. If you aren't sure about the organization's validity or can't find a link to unsubscribe, use your email client's tools to spam the message. Gmail provides an unsubscribe and spam tools such as the ones shown below:

1. Click the *Unsubscribe* link. ![Unsubscribe link](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/gmail-unsubscribe-link.png)

2. Click the *Unsubscribe* button to verify.![Unsubscribe button](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/gmail-unsubscribe-dialog.png)

3. Next choose the option to move the original email to the Spam folder to report all future messages as spam in the even that unsubscribe does not work. ![Move to Spam](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/gmail-unsubscribe-report-spam.png)

These tools work well. Unfortunately, I only have my personal account in Gmail. For work, I am stuck with Outlook which only includes a report as spam option as shown below:

## Step 2: Delete, delete, and delete

Begin by deleting everything in your inbox older than 18 months (24 at the most).

Even if you do need the email info at a later date, you can rest assured that there's another non inbox zero user who has the original message! Don't feel ashamed to ask. The bragging you get to do about inbox zero is far greater than the embarrasement of asking someone for a past message.

Email rules can automate the removal of messages. For instance, I do not need to know when everyone responds to an invite to attend a meeting, that's what the meeting invite is for, so I use rules to automatically delete these responses. I also have a rule that deletes forwards of forwards since those are almost always chain emails.

## Step 3: Schedule time to inbox zero

After you prune and automate your inbox, you will use steps four through six daily to tidy up your inbox. Before you start these steps, block out a couple of hours to a half day to complete your first triage session (depending on the number of message in your inbox).

## Step 4: Daily triage

You receive messages daily. The best case scenario is for you to review all messages at once, on a computer, at a specific time, during the day; however, depending on your role within an organization, this may not be an option. In this case, use your mobile phone to triage your email throughout the day. I define triage as:

1. Delete messages that have no value (you know the ones)
2. Mark messages as spam and unsubscribe
3. Respond to messeages when they only require a one or two line response. If a longer response is needed, use your computer with a full-size keyboard because you are wasting time if you type and edit a reply on your mobile device. OPTIONAL: Use the voice typing features on your phone. I recommend [Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&hl=en_US) for both iOS and Android.

## Step 5: Make time for longer replies

If an email requires significant time to respond, switch to your calendar and schedule time. As a rule, if an answer requires more than one paragraph or research, I will not try to reply on my mobile device. I know me and this would just make me frustrated. And who needs more frustration in their life?

## Step 6: Create your personal information library

The most common comment I hear from naysayer colleagues is, "I can't move to inbox zero because I use it as a library of information." Come on, folks! No email client was ever designed to archive information. Those tools have been added because people don't clean out their inbox. What would happen if we left mail in our mailbox? The post office would stop delivering and if you are not careful, the same thing will happen with your mail client inbox. And who wants to try and search through piles of mail?

I see it all the time; people scrolling and scrolling to find a message they need. Instead of scrolling, try using the search tool built-in to the email client. Second, don't be amazed when that search tool lets you down. This was the single flaw in the system that caused me to create a text-based archival system.

So what's my system for email archival? I archive messages in folders on my computer in plain text files (or Markdown but that's for another post).

### Rational to use text files

Below are the five reasons I think you should use text files when archiving information:

1. Text files are always accessible. If you have basic text files from the late 1980s, you can still open and edit them because they are not in some proprietary format that has changed or is no longer supported.
2. Because the text files are not in some wacky format, they can be opened by any word processor if you need to repurpose the text for another document.
3. Plain text is easy to copy and paste (an email for instance). I regularly will copy text from a text file to share in an email. I also like to prewrite long emails in a text editor so I don't accidently send to early and so I can use that content in the future without retyping.
4. Text files can be quickly searched using the built-in tools of most operating systems. On a Mac, activate Spotlight. On Windows, tap the Windows key. On Chrome OS, press the search key. On Linux, refer to your distro for the proper file search tool.
5. A good text editor (more on that in a minute) can do things that not even a full-featured word process can do.

### Choosing the correct editor

To get you started, here are a few text editors you can try to create, edit, and organize your text files.

Standard OS Text Editor
Caret (Chrome OS)
Atom (Mac, Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS)

Don't use these apps to load a single text file; rather, load an entire folder of text files.

<insert image of this concept>

Don't want to set up folder on a computer but want access to all this text file goodness? Give [Simple Note](https://simplenote.com/) (Window, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web) a try. It's free, includes search, syncs across all devices, and if you ever do need your data as plain text, you can export everynote.

> Some of you may be thinking about Evernote for your notes. I do not recommend this app. First, Evernote does not store files as plain text and this makes it hard to export your data. Second, Evernote limits the number of devices you can sync with on a free account. Third, I like free options and Evernote continues to increase their cost.

### File names matter

I use the format YYYY-MM-DD at the BEGINNING of almost every file I create or copy to my computer. I've never had anyone ask me why I do this and I've noticed that to this day, there are only a few individuals who are aware of the advantages, listed below, of this naming convention:

1. You will always know, by reading the name of the file, when the file originated. Remember, if you modify a file, the date of the file changes. Most operating systems (OS) maintain a creation date, but not all share that information by default.
2. Sorting your files by name will always put files in chronological order.
3. You can use your computer's automated system to delete files, if you like, when they reach an expiration date. Granted, most OSs can already do this, but the date of a file changes if you modify it and using this date at the beginning of the file will always retain the files orgination date.
4. Use your computer's search (see number 4 of previous section) and search quickly for files by year, month, and even day (if you can remember it).

### Where to store the files

You could store files in a folder on your desktop or laptop; however, if you want to have access to these files anywhere, you need to place them in a file that syncs across devices. Doing so will make this system really shine!

Imagine being on the go and someone asks you a question about information you have stored in one of these text files. Because you have these files in a folder synced across devices, you can use the mobile devices browse or search tools to quickly located the file and retrieve the information.

If you want this type of access, don't just save them to a folder on your desktop or laptop. Save the files to a Google Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox folder and then sync that folder across all your devices.

## Step 7: Create a routine

Schedule a couple of hours every week on your calendar to reach inbox zero. I try and do this twice a week (and admittedly am not always successful, but never have over 50 messages in my inbox at one time).

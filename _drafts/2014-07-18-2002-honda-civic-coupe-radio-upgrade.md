We recently purchased a [2002 Honda Civic Couple](!g) to replace an aging [1991 Toyota Camry](!g). The 2002 Honda Civic is in amazing condition and still has the factory radio installed. My wife, Nikki, is the primary driver of the vehicle and one of the things she enjoys about driving my [2004 Honda CR/V](!g) is the bluetooth connectivity integrated into the aftermarket [Clarion CX501](!am) head unit I installed several years back. I decided to give her car a significant upgrade that would provide not only bluetooth connectivity, but also iPhone app compatibility and a much larger screen than her iPhone for navigation.

In this post I will present the car radio selected, the additional components necessary for a professional installation, and the process. Let's begin with the part lists should you wish to duplicate the install.

## Parts List:

1. [Pioneer AVH-X2600BT](!am)
1. [Pioneer CD-IU201V USB to 30-pin Interface Cable for iPod/iPhone](!am) - Optional for iPhone video
1. [Metra 70-1721 Radio Wiring Harness](!am)
1. [Scosche Dash Kit for 2001 - 2005 Honda Civic Double Din](!am)
1. [MicroBypass Video In Motion Interface For Use With Pioneer Models AVH-100DVD AVH-200BT AVH-X1500DVD AVH-X1600DVD AVH-X2500BT AVH-X2600BT AVH-X3500BHS](!am)
1. [TaoTronicsÂ® TT-CC22 Bar Type Car License Plate Mount Rear View Backup Camera](!am)
1. [E-PRANCE New Car Door Clip Panel Audio Video Dashboard Dismantle Kits Installer Pry Tool](!am)
2. 8mm socket and ratchet
3. Philips screwdriver
4. [Insulated butt connectors](!am)
5. [Wire Crimpers](!am)
6. [Maker's Notebook](!am) or paper
7. Pen (I like the [Pilot Micro 207](!am)) or pencil
8. Scissors - cut open bags without ripping important information

## Inside preparation

Before we begin with the install I will first do some preliminary wiring to connect the [Metra 70-1721 Radio Wiring Harness](!am) to the [Pioneer AVH-X2600BT](!am) wiring harness. This is a wire-by-wire process and Metra makes this a very easy task by including the color codes on the back of the bag as shown in the image below.

I will begin with an install of the [MicroBypass Video In Motion Interface For Use With Pioneer Models AVH-100DVD AVH-200BT AVH-X1500DVD AVH-X1600DVD AVH-X2500BT AVH-X2600BT AVH-X3500BHS](!am) adapter. This adapter allows video when the car is not in park. [Microbypass](!g) provides instructions in the bag. Starting with the adapter first will ensure I don't make connections that must be broken later in the process.

TIP: As a reminder, cover wires not used with electrical tape as shown in the image below.

Once I have all the wires connected, see my wire bundle below. A few notes about my wire bundle:

* It's not pretty, but doesn't have to be
* The four wires wrapped in electrical tape are those wires not used
* I used the butt connectors as terminator, this allows me to get a volt meter to test the connection or to add other connections later

I am now ready to begin removal of the radio from the car.

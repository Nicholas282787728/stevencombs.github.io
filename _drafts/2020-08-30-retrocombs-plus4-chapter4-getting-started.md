In this Commodore Plus/4 retroCombs episode, I cover chapter 4 of the Commodore Plus/4 user's manual. In this chapter, _Getting Started_ we learn...

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`‚á™`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`‚åÉ`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`‚éã`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`‚åÇ`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`‚å´`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`‚èé`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`‚áß`  | Shift         |      |

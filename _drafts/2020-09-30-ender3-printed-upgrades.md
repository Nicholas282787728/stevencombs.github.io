In [a previous post](https://www.stevencombs.com/3dprinting/2019/06/02/set-up-ender3.html) I wrote about my experience setting up my new Creality Ender-3 and producing my first print. The next step in my 3D Printer journey was to begin printing upgrades. This post will capture those upgrades. I will update this post as I add additional features. I decided to print each upgrade using [MIKA3D black PLA](https://amzn.to/2IecWi0) so the objects would seamlessly blend in with the original design. Let's start our 3D printer upgrade by printing new parts!

# Printing preparation
Before I share the 3D printed upgrades, I feel I should share my process to prepare each print for the [Creality Ender-3 printer](https://amzn.to/2EL2hKE). I am using Elementary OS on an older Intel i5 based computer and the [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software) software, but no matter your PC setup, the steps below should be similar:

1. Connect the Creality Ender-3 microSD to a PC
2. Find a model on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).
3. Download the .zip file that contains the model. I created a folder that was backed up on Google Drive so I have an archive of all my files in case I need to reprint.
4. Extract the .zip archive to reveal the folder containing all contents. At this point, I delete the archive file because I am only looking for a single .stl file.
5. Locate the .stl file. Hint. It will be in the *file* folder.
6. Open the .stl file in Cura. 
7. Select the correct Cura 3D printer profile that matches your 3D printer. This is probably a topic for another post, but there is a ton of information when you perform a simple Google Search and if this is the first time you've fired up Cura, it will step you through the process.
8. Select the quality of the print. The *normal* option should be sufficient, but at least for one model below that included knurling, I chose *fine*.
9. Choose the *Slice* button to prepare the model.
10. Download the new .gcode file to the microSD card. You can save the model directly to the card, but you can also save to the PC and then copy it. Alternatively, if you have your 3D printer connected to an OctoPi server and have connected Cura to the server, you just click *Print on 3D Printer* (my setup). If you use a microSD card, complete the final steps below.
11. Eject the microSD card from the PC.
12. Place the microSD card in the 3D printer.
13. Turn on the 3D printer.
14. Follow your Crealty instructions to continue the print process.

# Cable clips

Cable clips keep things clean and ensure cables don't get tangled in moving parts. Here are the clips that worked for me.

# Controller fan cover

The first print I recommend is a cover for the controller fan at the front of the printer. Why? Because if you aren't careful, cooled PLA can fall of the bed and fall into the fan. The cover will also add some sound insulation and in the case of this cover, make your printer look, "cooler!" Pun intended. ðŸ˜„

# Extruder knob

There were several extruder knobs available, but I was looking for something small. The one chosen has some additional features that looked interesting to include knurling. You will use this knob when changing out filament. When you remove filament, a small amount remains. When swapping with a different color or material, warm up your hot end, install the new material, and turn the knob until all the old material is pushed through the hot end by the new material.

![Extruder knob]()

There were tiny holes on the knob that included excess material. I used one of the small Allen wrenches included with the 3D printer to clean out the holes.

{UPDATE: I may try another. This one will suffice for now, but the quality of the top is a bit rough. Not enough to make me print another now though.}

# Display back cover plate
The control panel's electronics are exposed behind the panel. It's not a big issue, but you do find your hand occasionally underneath when you push the controller button. This plate is unique in that you can use the factory screws. Some designs require new, longer, screws.

# Vent ring version 2
I wasn't really sure if I needed this, but it looked cool and didn't require a ton of filament or time to try.

What a great Father's Day gift! Today, and a complete surprise to me, my wife handed me a blue box to open. The box had been sitting on my desk for about a week with a note, "do not open until Father's Day." This morning, it was on the kitchen table and presented with a fresh stack of hot pancakes and hot coffee. I do have a wonderful wife!

I opened the package and low and behold, I found a Syma X12S mini quadcopter. I have another [Syma quadcopter](http://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2015/02/15/syma-x5c-1-unboxing.html), the X5C1. The X5C1 is a full size quadcopter with a camera. This smaller Syma is drastically smaller with a total width of about 3.5 inches. A comparison is shown in the image below.

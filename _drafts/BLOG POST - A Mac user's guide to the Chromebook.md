I like technology. I can't help myself. I try it all and one of the products taunting me was a Chromebook. I am unsure why the device fascinates me. Is it the simplicity? Is it the synchronization with the Chrome browser on my Mac? Was the Linux underpinnings? I'm really not sure, but I wanted one!

I had tried Chrome OS on an old Acer netbook, but the experience was a hack and as such, so was the performance. On top of that, my trial occurred over two years ago. My understanding is that Chrome OS has come a long way and I want to experience a "real" Chromebook - one with the logo on the case and one created exclusively for the Chrome OS. I choose the [Acer C720](!a).

During Black Friday 2014, Amazon sold the [Acer C720 Chromebook](!a) for only $150. Amazon reviews were excellent (4.5 stars). This was a comfortable price-point so I pulled the trigger. This blog post will not be a review of this particular Chromebook. That may come later. What this post provides is a look at Chrome OS from a Mac user's perspective. It will contain my observations and also some tips and trick to make the transition a bit easier for Mac users who want to transition to a Chromebook or who want a Chromebook to supplement their Mac.

# Performance
The most important feature of any computer is performance. All the apps in app store don't matter if performance is sluggish and cause frustration. Luckily, at least on the Acer C720, performance is excellent. My Chromebook boots up and connects to my Wi-Fi network in about 10 secs. Not a single Mac I own can claim those speeds. 

Normal usage responsiveness is similar to an iPad. Click on the Chrome browser and it immediately appears. Search results appear as quickly as your internet connection can provide them. Shutdown is immediate. Given the [Chrome OS Linux](!w) underpinnings combined with the on board solid state drive (SSD), this level of performance is expected and appreciated. All in all, performance and battery life on a modern Chromebook is very similar to the current crop of entry level Mac laptops.

# Keyboard
When you take a quick look at the keyboard on a Chromebook, the differences between it and the Mac are visibly noticeable. There is no command key (key icon), no shift lock, and functions keys are tied to the Chromebook and OS features. On my particular Acer C720 Chromebook, keys were large, comfortable and easy to read. This made the transition a bit easier.

Keyboard shortcuts are very different from the Mac. My muscle memory was confused during the transition. The control key is used in lieu of the missing command key and that key is very far to the left. Using my pinky finger to activate the search box was a change from my command key double-tap Alfred activation, but was easily made. Helpful is the onscreen keyboard shortcut tool that is activated using:

ctrl + alt + ?

{INSERT IMAGE OF KEYBOARD OVERLAY}

This is a fabulous tool that I wish were integrated in to OS X. To help the new Mac user out, I've included a list of keyboard shortcuts that will make your transition a bit easier.

# Touchpad
The touchpad on a Chromebook is very similar to the track pad found on a Mac laptop sans a few features. There is a single button underneath the touchpad, that I rarely use, and no other buttons. Scrolling direction be default mimics old school scrolling. If you want the modern Apple approach to scrolling, select the Australian scrolling option in the touchpad settings. Scrolling will now be more familiar and natural.

Currently, there is no pinch to zoom option or multi-finger gestures. The only features currently are:

* tap to select
* two-finger tap right-click
* two-finger scroll

That's pretty limited; however, the experimental features page (enter chrome:flags in the URL box) does list pinch-to-zoom options so there is hope that these features are on the way.

# Files
File management is basic, and I'm talking bare bones necessities. The Files app, shown in the image below, is a stripped down version of the Finder found on a Mac. You won't find handy items like tabs or shortcuts. 

{INSERT FILES APP IMAGE} 

There are two areas within the left-hand files area of the app: Google Drive files at the top and local files at the bottom. Local files are files stored on the Chromebook. They do not automatically sync to Google Drive. This is important to know. If you want access to the files on your Mac, you need to save documents and files to Google Drive. This is not the default. You can change the default however in the Settings using these steps:

1. Select the Settings icon.
2. Click Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.
3. In the "Downloads" section, click the Change button to pick a default download location.

I use a folder on Google Drive named *Downloads*. Any download on my Chromebook will copy to my Mac when using the [Google Drive for Mac](!g) app. This location also becomes the default location for all new files created by other apps on the Chromebook.

You can perform basic file management with the Chrome OS Files app such as:

* search local and Google Drive files
* move files
* copy files
* create folders
* rename files/folders
* delete files/folders
* share Google Drive files

You can also view thumbnail previews of files. Think of this as a scaled down version of **Quick Look** on the Mac. Move the cursor over the thumbnail at the bottom of the Files app as shown in the image below and a mini version of the document appears.

# Search
Similar to **Spotlight**, Chrome OS includes Google Search integration within the operating system. A simple tap of the magnifier button found above the left shift key will display the Chrome OS app launcher as shown in the image below. 

{INSERT IMAGE OF GOOGLE SEARCH BUTTON AND SCREENSHOT}

At the top of the launcher is the search box. It is active by default so you can immediately type a search request. Search results will include:

* installed Chrome OS applications
* relevant and personalized Google search results
* Chrome OS app store results

To select a search result, use the arrow up/down keys to highlight and press return.

You can also use the search box to make quick calculations and conversions, as you can with Spotlight. Instead of a search query, just enter your calculation or conversion such as:

* 2+2*7  
* tablespoons in a 1/4 cup
* 25m to feet

The results will appear as the second result. The first result will perform a Google search for the query. This is very handy!

Missing from the results are items such as showtimes, weather, stocks, etc. I've become use to these in the iPhone [Google App](!itu). Inclusion of these results would make the search box more useful and on par with other Mac launch/search tools such as Spotlight, [Alfred](!mas) and [LaunchBar](!g).

# Browser
If you use the Chrome Browser on your Mac the transition to a Chromebook will be a breeze.  As long as you log into your Google account while using Chrome on the Mac, and data sync on, all your bookmarks, passwords, apps, etc will sync to your new Chromebook. Adding additional items to your Chromebook will then transfer back to your Mac Chrome browser almost instantaneously. I won't go into a review of the Chrome browser, but will say that using it on both the Mac and on the Chromebook, I prefer using it on the Chromebook.

# Applications
On of the things I noticed from my previous use of Chrome OS from two years ago is that the Chromebook now has true applications. Before, applications exclusively lived online and required a Wi-Fi connection. And while most apps you find in the Web Store are nothing more than bookmarks to online apps, more and more of them are now true native apps. The Web Store even has a new area devoted to these [offline apps](http://goo.gl/u5Dpq).

Apps are easy to install and the experience is very similar to the Mac App Store. Search for an app and hit the Free or Cost button. The app is immediately installed. You don't even have to enter your password again for free apps as you do on the Mac App Store. Once installed, the app icons appear in the Apps launcher locate on the shelf. Appearance of the icons is similar to the Applications icon found on the OS X Dock. A simple click of the icon will load the app.

# Shelf
The Shelf is similar to the Dock in OS X. As mentioned above, it contains the Apps launcher and can store any app shortcuts you place on it. Like the dock, it can auto-hide and change positions to either the bottom, left or right of the screen. One think I wish you could do with the Shelf is use it as a place to store commonly used bookmarks.

Once an app is on the shelf, there is another useful feature, open as window

# Fullscreen
While Chrome OS does not include a spaces feature, it does support fullscreen apps. 

* run apps full screen
* run apps expanded

Hit the ____ key to reveal a ____ similar to the Mac ____ feature

I’ve read online where many grouse about the Web Store apps being simple bookmarks to websites. This is true; however, if you use these links and make the selections above, these bookmarks become useful. Here’s the way I use them…

# Miscellaneous
Below are some items that may or may not be a part of a Mac user’s regular tools. The observations below are for speciality utilities and features that I use that may be of interest to others.

## iCloud
If you want access to your iWork files, you will be happy to know that the online version of iWork works well on a Chromebook. Given the cloud nature of the Chromebook, the two are a perfect fit. 

## Screenshots
Macs make it easy to take a screen shot using the following keyboard combinations:

xxx - capture screen
xxx - capture area

Chromebooks contain the same feature but use these keyboard combinations:

xxx - capture screen
xxx - capture area

The Chromebook provides a notification after each capture. This notification also provides and option to copy the recently captured image to the clipboard. Actual files are saved in your default file location as demonstrated in the [Files](#Files) section above.

## Text Expansion
Many Mac users use text expander utilities such as [TextExpander](!itu). Sadly, I am not able to locate a viable substitute. This is a utility I utilize often and even a rudimentary app to provide this function would be appreciated.

## Dictation
Dictation is relatively new to OS X, so it stands to reason that the Chromebook may not have this capability built-in; however, I also didn’t find a viable alternative in the Chrome Web Store. Given Google’s powerful voice search, it would be a nice addition to include this feature for both normal and assistive device users.

## Voice Search
While dictation is not available, voice search is making its way into Chrome OS.

I like technology. I can't help myself. I try it all and one of the products taunting me was a Chromebook. I am unsure why the device fascinates me. Is it the simplicity? Is it the synchronization with the Chrome browser on my Mac? Was the Linux underpinnings? I'm really not sure, but I wanted one!

I had tried Chrome OS on an old Acer netbook, but the experience was a hack and as such, so was the performance. On top of that, my trial occurred almost a year and a half ago. My understanding is that the Chrome OS has come a long way and I wanted a "real" Chromebook. One with the logo on the case and one created exclusively for the Chrome OS. I choose the Acer C720.

During Black Friday 2014, Amazon sold the Acer C720 Chromebook for only $150. Amazon reviews were excellent (4.5 stars). This was a comfortable price-point so I pulled the trigger. This blog post will not be a review of this particular Chromebook. That may come later. What this post provides is a look at Chrome OS from an Mac user's perspective. It will contain my observations and also some tips and trick to make the transition a bit easier for anyone who wants to move from a Mac to a Chromebook or who wants a Chromebook as a supplement to their Mac. Let's get started.


# Performance
The most important feature of any computer is performance. All the tools in world don't matter if the reaction times are sluggish and frustrating. Luckily, at least on the Acer C720, performance is excellent. My Chromebook boots up and connects to my Wi-Fi network in about 10 secs. Not a single Mac I own can claim those speeds.

Normal operations feels generally as speedy. Opening the Chrome browser is instantaneous as is almost every selection made. Given the Chrome OS Linux pinnings, this is not really a surprise to me. The Linux base is extremely stripped down to only include the necessities. 

# Track pad
The track pad on a Chromebook is very similar to the track pad found on

# Keyboard
When you take a quick look at the keyboard on a Chromebook, the differences between it and the Mac are visibly noticeable. There is no command key (key icon), no shift lock, and functions keys are tied to the Chromebook and OS features. On my particular Acer C720 Chromebook, keys were large, comfortable and easy to read. This made the transition a bit easier.

Keyboard shortcuts are very different from the Mac. My muscle memory was confused during the transition. The control key is used in lieu of the missing command key and that key is very far to the left. Using my pinky finger to activate the search box was a change from my command key double-tap Alfred activation, but was easily made. Helpful is the onscreen keyboard shortcut tool that is activated using:

ctrl + alt + ?

This is a fabulous tool that I wish were integrated in to OS X. To help the new Mac user out, I've included a list of keyboard shortcuts that will make your transition a bit easier.

# Spotlight
Similar to Apple's Spotlight feature, Chrome OS include Google Search integration within the operating system. A simple tap of the magnifier button found above the left shift key, will display the Chrome OS app launcher as shown in the image below.

At the top of the launcher is the search box. It is active by default so you can immediately type a search request. Search results will include:

* installed Chrome OS applications
* relevant and personalized Google search results
* Chrome OS app store results

To select a search result, use the arrow up/down keys to highlight and press return.

You can also use the search box to make quick calculations and conversions, as you can with spotlight. Instead of a search query, just enter your calculation or conversion such as:

* 2+2*7  
* tablespoons in a 1/4 cup
* 25m to feet

The results will appear as the second result. The first result will perform a Google search for the query. This is very handy!

Missing are immediate search results for items such as showtimes, weather, stocks, etc. Inclusion of these results would make the search box a more useful and robust tool that is on par with other Mac launch/search tools such as Spotlight, Alfred and Launchbar.

# Chrome Browser
If you use the Chrome Browser on your Mac the transition to a Chromebook will be much easier. As long as you log into your Google account while using Chrome and have all your data sync...

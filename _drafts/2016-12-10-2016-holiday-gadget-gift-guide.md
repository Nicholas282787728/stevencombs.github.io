Santa Combs is here to help with your last minute Christmas shopping. Below are the gadgets I used this past year that I recommend you add to your list from Santa or gift to your friends and family.

# Mobile Tech
Consider these mobile technology devices to increase your productivty while on the go.

## Google Pixel Phone
I've already posted [my thoughts on the Pixel Phone][1], Google's first attempt to produce a mobile phone of the same quality and caliber as an Apple iPhone. In my view, this is the best Android phone on the market. While the high cost might lead some to look elsewhere, Android phone users looking for a pure Google premium phone need look no further. Get Google's [Project Fi](https://fi.google.com/) service to save money on your montly service.

## Acer R13 Chromebook
Google is doing something very interesting with Chrome OS this year; they are adding access to the Android App Store (Play Store) to some Chromebooks. The new 13 inch Acer R13 Chromebook is one of the first (in beta) and the more I use this feature the more I like it. The R13 is an aluminum convertible laptop. That is, the screen can fold back on the keyboard to become a touch screen tablet. It's a bit bulky, but very compelling. For a less expensive plastic 11 inch option, try the [Acer R11 Chromebook](http://amzn.to/2gDL36E) ($279.00).

## Amazon Fire Tablets
Amazon creates several Fire Tablets in various sizes. While these tablets don't have access to the Google Play Store, don't have exceptional battery life, nor have the most powerful processors, these are the Volkswagen (from the 40s and 50s) of the tablet world. Utilitarian, easy to use, affordable and rugged, these are the perfect handheld devices for the average consumer. We have two extra inexpensive tablets we use to control our home automation or simply browse the web while watching television.

## Anker USB Charger
USB chargers come in various shapes, sizes and capacities. A good one is often hard to find, but Anker provides one of the best. The Anker Quick Charge 3.0 is a 60 watt USB charging powerhouse. Anker's "IQ" charging allows connected devices to suck juice as quickly as it can take it. And not just one device at a time, but up to 6. Our Anker charger sits in a charging desk with various cables easily accessible.

I liked their 6 port version so much, I use their smaller 24 watt two port option for traveling.

# Audio/Video

## Anker SoundCore
A good Bluetooth speaker is imporatant to any gadget loving geek. The Anker SoundCore is my favorite to through into my travel bag. Purchase a case to keep is safe and secure.

## Amazon Fire TV Stick
If you need a 4K experience, look to the Fire TV instead of the Fire TV Stick.

## Sonos Play:1


# Physical Computing


## Raspberry Pi 3

## C.H.I.P.

## PocketC.H.I.P.


# Home Automation

## Amazon Echo Dot
When the original Amazon Echo was released, [I wrote all about it](http://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2015/02/21/amazon-echo-review.html). The Echo Dot carries on the tradtion of the original, but in a smaller form factor and less impressive speaker system; however, it also came with a lower cost. We have an Amazon Echo and two Echo Dots in our home. Each gives us voice access to music, infomation and control of our home automation equipment.

[Get the Amazon Echo Dot](http://amzn.to/2gDLNbW) - $49.99

## Wemo Switch Smart Plug
The Wemo Switch Smart Plug is one of the simplest and most inexpensive ways build a home automation system. Plug it into the wall, plug in a lamp, use the Wemo app to configure and you can now turn lamps, or other devices, on and off with your phone or tablet. Configure rules to have lights come on at specific times. The Wemo switch is compatible with the Amazon Echo (above), so after you configure the the switch in the Amazon Alexa app, you can then control that same light using your voice. Welcome to the 21st century.

## Hue Bulb Starter Kit.
A bit more complicated than the Wemo suggestion above, but far more sophisticated, is the Hue Bulb Starter Kit. Unlike the Wemo, that will convert a normal lamp and bulb into a smart device, the Hue Bulb Starter Kit uses smart bulbs that screw into existing lamps. They are controlled by a hub that connects to your home router. Because this system uses bulbs, rather then outlet plugs, it's a bit more streamlined. Hue provides white bulbs as well as bulbs that can change color (a whole lot of fun during the holidays).

## GE Link Smart LED Light Bulb
If you already have a Philips Hue system in your home, save money and purchase these [$13 smart white LED bulbs from GE][2]. They integrate well into the Philips Hue system and will save you a bundle if you simply want white lights that can turn on/off or dim.

# Accessories (and Stocking Stuffers!)

## Anker Anker PowerCore 10000
If you have a mobile device, you need an external battery in case of emergencies or a long day of picture taking and tweeting. Once again, Anker comes to the rescure with their affordable and powerful PowerCore 10000 with high speed charging. This device will charge most phone three times before you need to recharge the PowerCore.

## Logitech K400 Keyboard

## IKEA Battery Charger

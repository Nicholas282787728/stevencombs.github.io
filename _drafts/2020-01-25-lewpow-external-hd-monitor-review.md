During Black Friday, I was able to snag a deal on the [Lepow 15.6 Inch Full HD 1080P USB Type-C Computer Display IPS Eye Care Screen with HDMI Type C](https://amzn.to/38JWMJt) for $110! I will admit, this may have been a bit of an impluse buy; however, I rationalized to myself that there are many times when either me or my wife needed a second monitor on our laptops (her's Macbook and mine a Pixelbook). Will this monitor suffice? Let's find out in this bullet review.

The items are stored in vacuumed formed piece of plastic and the box is above average packaging. Not quite Apple or Google quality, but very good for a third-party product.

Included is a USB-C to USB-A cable to connect to a 5 volt and 2000 milliamp power brick.

After removing a piece of foam, the following is revealed:

* A screen protection - which looks incredibly difficult to apply without a bunch of bubbles and makes me worry about scratches
* A warranty card with online activation instructions
* Gift card (a free product for a review on Amazon)
* The Monitor

Removing the monitor I found a couple of surprises:

* An HDMI to mini HDMI cable
* A USB-C to USB-C cable

![Cables]()

These were probably listed as being included, but I didn't notice them and found their inclusion to be a very nice touch. With these cables, I don't believe there's a device I cannot connect to.

Below everything else was a user's guide which was more comprehensive than I would have thought.

The monitor includes a case with magnetic clasps that is similar to folding cases found on tablet devices. I took some time reading the guide to ensure I knew how to fold the case.

## First Test

The first test was to operate the monitor as second display for my Pixelbook. I would use the USB-C to USB-C cable only. The cable provided will work well and is of really high quality. My first question was would the Pixelbook power the Lepow monitor so I wouldn't have to use an external power source.

And the anwers was, ABSOLUTELY!!! It was a perfect match for the Pixelbook. The connection was seamless and the Pixelbook configured itself perfectly. The only thing I had to do was kick up the brightness. Now this monitor is not as bright or high resolution as the native Pixelbook screen, but it is a more than acceptable second monitor.

The big question is how long can you actually use this monitor with a Pixelbook on a full battery charge. I may have to try that at some point. For now, I'm just thrilled at how well this works!

I found an HDR setting on the built-in controls and was able to modify the screen for bright and vibrant colors on video.

The monitor even includes stereo audio. Now they won't win any audio quality awards, but they are good enough.

## Good

## Not So Good

Here are some of the negatives of this monitor (but not enough to stop me from recommending):

  *  Monitor settings are not maintained between power-ups
  *  Monitor is not the brightest you will find
  *  Colors are a bit washed out

## My Mobile Setup

Here's an image of my Pixel Slate traveling office. Beneath the image is a description of each item and an Amazon link if you are interested in creating your own mobile office setup. If so, drop a comment below.

[Pixel Slate](https://amzn.to/36nZRws) - The Pixel Slate is still my favorite Chrome OS device. The versatility of having a laptop or tablet form factor make it the most useful device I own.

[Logitech M557 Bluetooth Mouse](https://amzn.to/2RmD6Vx) - The slate blue matches the Slate nicely and Bluetooth means I don't have to schlepp around more cables.

[Anker SoundCore 2](https://amzn.to/2GnOHxo) - Another Bluetooth hardware device that provides great sound from YouTube Music (on the external monitor in this image) while I work.

[LePow 15.6" USB-C External Monitor](https://amzn.to/37rcKam) - Purchased on a whim during Black Friday, this external monitor plus in to the right-side USB-C port that provides video out and power. The monitor folds up into it's own folio case and is as thin as the Slate.

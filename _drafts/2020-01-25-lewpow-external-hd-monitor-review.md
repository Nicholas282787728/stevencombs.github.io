During Black Friday 2019, I was able to snag a deal on the [Lepow 15.6 Inch Full HD 1080P USB Type-C Computer Display IPS Eye Care Screen with HDMI Type C](https://amzn.to/38JWMJt) for $110! I will admit, this may have been a bit of an impluse buy; however, I rationalized to myself that there are many times when either me or my wife needed a second monitor on our laptops (her's a Macbook and mine a Pixelbook). Will this monitor suffice? Let's find out in this bullet review.

The items are stored in vacuumed formed piece of plastic and the box is above average packaging. Not quite Apple or Google quality, but very good for a third-party product.

Included is a USB-C to USB-A cable to connect to a 5 volt and 2000 milliamp power brick.

After removing a piece of foam, the following is revealed:

* A screen protection - which looks incredibly difficult to apply without a bunch of bubbles and makes me worry about scratches
* A warranty card with online activation instructions
* Gift card (a free product for a review on Amazon)
* The Monitor

[Protector and cards]()

Removing the monitor I found a couple of surprises:

* An HDMI to mini HDMI cable
* A USB-C to USB-C cable

![Cables]()

These were probably listed as being included, but I didn't notice them and found their inclusion to be a very nice touch. With these cables, I don't believe there's a device I cannot connect to.

Below everything else was a user's guide which was more comprehensive than I would have thought.

The monitor includes a case with magnetic clasps that is similar to folding cases found on tablet devices. I took some time reading the guide to ensure I knew how to fold the case.

## First Test

The first test was to operate the monitor as second display for my Pixelbook. I would use the USB-C to USB-C cable only. The cable provided will work well and is of really high quality. My first question was would the Pixelbook power the Lepow monitor so I wouldn't have to use an external power source.

And the anwers was, ABSOLUTELY!!! It was a perfect match for the Pixelbook. The connection was seamless and the Pixelbook configured itself perfectly. The only thing I had to do was kick up the brightness. Now this monitor is not as bright or high resolution as the native Pixelbook screen, but it is a more than acceptable second monitor.

The big question is how long can you actually use this monitor with a Pixelbook on a full battery charge. I may have to try that at some point. For now, I'm just thrilled at how well this works!

I found an HDR setting on the built-in controls and was able to modify the screen for bright and vibrant colors on video.

The monitor even includes stereo audio. Now they won't win any audio quality awards, but they are good enough.

## Good

1. Folio case protects and serves as a stand for the monitor.
2. Light, thin, and easy to throw into my bag with my Pixelbook or Pixel Slate.
2. Screen protector includes; however, it is very difficult to apply.

## Not So Good

Here are some of the negatives of this monitor (but not enough to stop me from recommending):

1. Monitor settings are not maintained between power-ups. You will have to work through them each and every time.
2. Monitor is not very bright on default settings or after max brightness is applied. The monitor is fine for indoors but will be hard to see outside.
3. Colors are washed out on the default settings and don't get a whole lot better after correcting; however, it is definitely better than expected for the price I paid. If you select HDR mode in the monitor settings, prepare for an amazing experience with video that is horrible with normal web browsing.
4. Folio case cannot serve as a stand for the monitor in portrait mode. I recommend [this stand]() in this use case.

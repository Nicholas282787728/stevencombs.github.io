During February 2017, I announced that I will write my first work of fiction. This became official in a [blog post][1] on this site and on Facebook to my friends and family. Other authors state that accountability is an important component of the process. Think, "Hi!, I'm Steven and I'm a budding author." What follows is my "seven-step" process.

[I am a published technical writer][2]. Fiction is a whole other ball game. I know my limitations and lack of experience writing fiction. Because of this, I would have to take a self-designed crash course in creative writing and I only have nine months to do so. Why nine months? Because I also made the conscious decision to begin my first draft during National Novel Writing Month ([NaNoWriMo][3]). NaNoWriMo occurs in November of each year.

# NaNoWriMo
If you are not familiar with NaNoWriMo, I encourage you to [visit their site][4]. If you are a budding author, I truly believe this is the primer to the pump that will get you started. Here's the quick synopsis from their site:

> On November 1, participants begin working towards the goal of writing a 50,000-word novel by 11:59 PM on November 30. Valuing enthusiasm, determination, and a deadline, NaNoWriMo is for anyone who has ever thought about writing a novel.

What appeals to me is what I stated earlier, accountability. There are opportunities to post your intent to publish, find a writing partner and join local groups. I have been aware of NaNoWriMo since 2011, the year I created my account, but I have yet to participate. This will be my year!

Given my lack of history with fiction, I wasn't quite sure how to begin; however, a wonderful book set me on the right course.

# Fast Fiction
If you are interested in participating in NaNoWriMo, let me suggest a wonderful book by Denise Jaden. [Fast Fiction: A Guide to Outlining and Writing a First-Draft Novel in Thirty Days][5] will provide the basic tools and tips you need to get started. Here's a quick synopsis from the [Amazon Page][6]:

> Writers flock to National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) each November because it provides a procrastination-busting deadline. But only a fraction of the participants meet their goal. Denise Jaden was part of that fraction, writing first drafts of her two published young adult novels during NaNoWriMo. In Fast Fiction, she shows other writers how to do what she did, step-by-step, writer to writer. Her process starts with a prep period for thinking through plot, theme, characters, and setting. Then Jaden provides day-by-day coaching for the thirty-day drafting period. Finally, her revision tips help writers turn merely workable drafts into compelling and publishable novels.

As I read through Denise's tips and tricks, I kept notes in a [Field Notes Reporter's Notebook][7]. The Reporter's Notebook is the perfect form factor and it also became a bookmark. 

At the end of each *Fast Fiction* chapter is homework. I used the same Reporter's Notebook to capture this work. Denise helped me nail down the premise of my book as well as a very rough outline. When NaNoWriMo begins, I will return to the book. In roughly the last third of the book, Denise provides day-by-day NaNoWriMo activities to get your synapses firing for a day of writing. More than anything else, it was Denise's book that told me, "you can do this!"

# The premise
I mention that Denise's book was key to the development of my premise. The premise was a long time coming. I've actually had several ideas in my head for years (never wrote them down). I'm an alternative history, science fiction and retro computing fan. Several of my ideas involved one or the other. What I landed on initially was something that includes all three!

Thanks to Denise's book, what started as a "kinda interesting" premise, slowly turn into an action packed and intriguing conspiracy theory premise. As I worked through her book, I became more excited about my premise and couldn't wait to get started writing. However, there was still much work to do and it was time for some research.

# Research
Everything I read tells me to write about the things I love and know; however, while there are many components of my story that are very familiar, my historical setting means it is important that I get the facts correct. It is now time to do some research. 

I'm not sure how author's in the past did their research, but the Internet and Wikipedia are my new best friends. Accuracy is important, but in my alternative history narrative, it isn't critical. I can bend the timeline in my own world. However, I want the timeline to be familiar to the reader and ensure they feel comfortable living in it for 50,000 or so words. It is also important the everything flows into the eventual climax and that the reader ultimately says, "I see how it all fits now!"

Interestingly for me, as I did the research, history presented new ideas and opportunities for my story. As I captured notes in my Reporter's Notebook, I quickly made the decision that my notebook was not the best place to capture this information. I need a tool to write, tag, sort, archive and manage my writing project. The tool is already installed on my computer and I use it almost daily to capture notes and generate blog posts.

# Selecting writing tools
Scrivener is quickly becoming a favorite application among authors. I own a copy and several years ago I tried to use it to generate a rough outline of a book. I admittedly didn't know what I was doing back then and found Scrivener too daunting. It had many cool features, but it was lacking in one very significant way. Markdown is not the default. This is not a Markdown post so if you are not familiar with this markup language, I recommend you check out the [Wikipedia Markdown entry][8] for a quick summary.

I use Markdown daily in my professional career to capture notes and draft documents. I also use Markdown to write every blog post I create, like the one. I've used several Markdown apps over time, [Byword][9], [MultiMarkdown Composer][10], [Atom][11] and [nvALT][12]. I recommend all three due to their individual strengths. I also and an assortment of other options that were installed and quickly uninstalled. 

## I start with Ulysses
Because I am a heavy user of Markdown, Ulysses was installed on my computer. This is not a review of Ulysses, but I encourage you to check out [their web site][14] to learn why this tool is so popular among, not only users of Markdown, but also writers. 

## I supplement with Google Docs
One of the limitations of Ulysses is that it is an Apple ecosystem only application. I use many different devices. I have computers run macOS, ChromeOS and Linux. Mobile devices run both iOS and Android. Because I don't always have an Apple device with me and I do want to always have access to my writing, I decided to supplement my use of Ulysses with Google Drive applications to ensure I have anywhere access to my work. ++ do I use Markdown only on Google Drive? I'm leaning that way. ++

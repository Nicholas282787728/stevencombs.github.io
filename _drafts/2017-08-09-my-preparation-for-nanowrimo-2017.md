During February 2017, I announced that I will write my first work of fiction. This became official in a [blog post][1] on this site and on Facebook to my friends and family. Other authors state that accountability is an important component of the process. Think, "Hi!, I'm Steven and I'm a budding author." What follows is my preparation process.

[I am a published technical writer][2]. Fiction is a another ball game. I know my limitations and lack of experience writing fiction. Because of this, preparation requires a self-designed crash course in creative writing and I only had nine months. Why nine months? Because I also made the conscious decision to begin my first draft during National Novel Writing Month ([NaNoWriMo][3]). NaNoWriMo occurs in November of each year. Yikes! Time to get started.

# NaNoWriMo
If you are not familiar with NaNoWriMo, I encourage you to [visit their site][4]. If you are a budding author, I truly believe this is the primer to the pump that will get you started. Here's the quick synopsis from their site:

> On November 1, participants begin working towards the goal of writing a 50,000-word novel by 11:59 PM on November 30. Valuing enthusiasm, determination, and a deadline, NaNoWriMo is for anyone who has ever thought about writing a novel.

NaNoWriMo is just the accountability and gamification nudge I need. There are opportunities to post your intent to publish, find a writing partner, join local groups, gauge progress and win “stuff” if you meet the 50,000 word challenge. I have been aware of NaNoWriMo since 2011, the year I created my account, but I have yet to participate. This will be my year!

Given my lack of history with fiction, I wasn't quite sure how to begin; however, a wonderful book set me on the right course.

# Fast Fiction
If you are interested in participating in NaNoWriMo, let me suggest a wonderful book by Denise Jaden. [Fast Fiction: A Guide to Outlining and Writing a First-Draft Novel in Thirty Days][5] will provide the basic tools and tips you need to get started. Here's a quick synopsis from the [Amazon Page][6]:

> Writers flock to National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) each November because it provides a procrastination-busting deadline. But only a fraction of the participants meet their goal. Denise Jaden was part of that fraction, writing first drafts of her two published young adult novels during NaNoWriMo. In Fast Fiction, she shows other writers how to do what she did, step-by-step, writer to writer. Her process starts with a prep period for thinking through plot, theme, characters, and setting. Then Jaden provides day-by-day coaching for the thirty-day drafting period. Finally, her revision tips help writers turn merely workable drafts into compelling and publishable novels.

As I read through Denise's tips and tricks, I kept notes in a [Field Notes Reporter's Notebook][7]. The Reporter's Notebook is the perfect form factor. It also became a fairly thick bookmark in this book and several others will share a bit later.

At the end of each *Fast Fiction* chapter is homework. I used the same Reporter's Notebook to capture this work. While I didn’t complete all “assignments,” I did complete several to help me nail down my initial concept (which has been rattling around in my head for years). Further reading and assignments helped me generate a very rough outline. When NaNoWriMo begins, I will return to the book. In roughly the last third of the book, Denise provides day-by-day NaNoWriMo activities to get your synapses firing for a day of writing. More than anything else, it was Denise's book that told me, "you can do this!"

# The premise
I mention that Denise's book was key to the development of my premise. The premise was a long time coming. I've actually had several ideas in my head for years (never wrote them down). I'm an alternative history, science fiction and retro computing fan. Several of my ideas involved one or the other. What I landed on initially was something that includes all three!

Thanks to Denise's book, what started as a "kinda interesting" premise, slowly turn into an action packed and intriguing conspiracy theory premise. As I worked through her book, I became more excited about my premise and couldn't wait to get started writing. However, there was still much work to do and it was time for some research.

# Research
Everything I read about Fiction writing suggests I write about the things I love and know; however, while there are many components of my story that are very familiar, my historical setting makes it important that I get the facts correct (even if I do take a bit of alternative history spin on them).

I'm not sure how past author's conduct their research, but Wikipedia is my go to start point. Accuracy is important, but in my alternative history narrative, it isn't critical. I can bend the timeline in my own world. However, I want the timeline to be familiar to the reader and ensure they feel comfortable living in it for 50,000 or so words. It is also important that everything flows into the eventual climax and that the reader ultimately says, "I see how it all fits now!"

Interestingly for me, as I did the research, history presented new ideas and opportunities for my story. As I captured notes in my Reporter's Notebook, I quickly made the decision that my notebook was not the best place to capture this information. I need a tool to write, tag, sort, archive and manage my writing project. The tool is already installed on my computer and I use it almost daily to capture notes and generate blog posts.

# Selecting writing tools
Scrivener is quickly becoming a favorite application among authors. I own a copy and several years ago I tried to use it to generate a rough outline of a book. I admittedly didn't know to use the software and found Scrivener too daunting. It had many cool features, but it was lacking in one very significant way. Markdown is not the default. This is not a Markdown post so if you are not familiar with this markup language, I recommend you check out the [Wikipedia Markdown entry][8] for a quick summary.

I use Markdown daily in my professional career to capture notes and draft documents. I also use Markdown to write every blog post I create, like the one. I've used several Markdown apps over time, [Byword][9], [MultiMarkdown Composer][10], [Atom][11] and [nvALT][12]. Each has a unique feature that you may find perfect for your use and I still use Atom and Byword on occasion; however, there is one tool that I simply adore and am not sure how I could write without. 

## Ulysses is my writing tool
Because I am a heavy user of Markdown, Ulysses another app installed on my computer. This is not a review of Ulysses, but I encourage you to check out [their web site][13] to learn why this tool is so popular among, not only users of Markdown, but also writers. A word of caution; ignore the reviews you find on the iTunes Store. Many users are angry that Ulysses recently changed their pricing model to a subscription, and while I too did not like the change, I quickly found that my use of this tool in my professional career and during NaNoWriMo was inconsequential when I consider my productivity.

During the planning phase of my book, I use Ulysses to capture ideas, organizing research, [create timelines][14], draft character profiles, journal, and identify gaps using smart filters and tags. As you can tell, I am a planner and Ulysses has made this process efficient and fun.

## Supplement with Google Docs
One of the limitations of Ulysses is that it prefers an Apple ecosystem and many features are not available if you don’t use iCloud. Additionally, it is only available on macOS and iOS. I use many different devices. I have computers run macOS, ChromeOS and Linux. My mobile devices run both iOS and Android. Because I don't always have an Apple device with me and I do want to always have access to my writing, I decided to supplement my use of Ulysses with Google Drive applications to ensure I have anywhere access planning files. I also created a Google Slides document to visually represent characters and tech found in my novel. A sample of a character page and technology page is below.

Fast Fiction was the basis for what I would include on my slides for each character (as shown above). Images of characters came from a Google search and while they are not exactly how I imagine my characters, they are very close and even provide additional inspiration.

I choose my own data and references for the technology slides (like the one shown below)

![][image-2]

Some of my technology is a variation of current technology that I allow in my alternative history story. These slides are my canvas for the creation of these alternative designs. They inform and inspire my writing. I have a strong creative and visual side of my brain. This creative work prior to my writing is what will make me successful.

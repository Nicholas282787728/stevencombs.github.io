I’ve been playing with my new Pebble and one of the things I wanted to do was to create a unique watchface that had my college’s, [Ivy Tech Community College](http://www.ivytech.edu) brand. I found a great site that made this quick and easy:

[Watchface Generator for Pebble](http://www.watchface-generator.de/)

Below is a screenshot of my first watchface. Click on the image to download a copy if you want to wear your Ivy Tech pride on your Pebble watch.

The site uses a simple point and click interface lets you quickly create a new watch face.  My goal is to learn more about Pebble watchface development and my hope is that in future versions I can refine the image a bit and include a weather report.

I've learned during my time with THEVIC20(C64), that it is a devicive device. There are those, like me, who love that the system is keeping the retro-computing alive, while other lament that the system is nothing more than a mere emulated shadow of the original. Which ever side of the campfire you sit, my goal for this short series of videos was to shine a light on the games included with these systems. As I stated on several social media posts, the games are a collection of winners, stinkers, suprises and questions.

I had some time today to work through the first 13 VIC-20 games on my new <a href="https://twitter.com/THEC64_RGL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@THEC64_RGL</a> THEVIC20.

## Complete List of Games (and additional thoughts)

### Part 1 (Abductor ‚Üí Gridrunner)

Below are the list of games I demonstrate in part 1 of the series.

1. Abductor - 
2. Andes Attack - Inspired by Defender but with llamas in peril! Fun, retro, and addictive. Highly recommend this one.
3. Arcadia - 
4. Bewitched - Not related to the beloved 1960s-70s sitcom. More closely related to the Atari 2600 game, Adventure but with more keys and more maze.
5. Blitzkrieg - 
6. Brainstorm - 
7. Catcha Snatcha - 
8. Connect 4 - It's connect 4. What is there to say, only that the checkers are not round. Why not? No joystick support for this one.
9. Encounter - 
10. Frantic - 
11. Frog Chase - A frustrating version of Frogger that I found impossible. Feels like a BASIC program.
12. Gridrunner - Classic, and finally, a popular game included on THEVIC20. Frantic pace with great game play and audio. One of the VIC-20's best.

### Part 2 (Harvester ‚Üí Zor)

Below are the list of games I demonstrate in part 2 of the series.

1. Harvester - 
2. Headbanger‚Äôs Heaven - 
3. Hell Gate - 
4. Laser Zone - 
5. Martians - 
6. Matrix - Not based on the beloved 1990s film.
7. Mega Vault - 
8. Metagalactic Llamas Battle at the Edge of Time
9. Psychedelia - Not a game but a wonderful psychedelic simulation.
10. Snake
11. Starquest
12. Subspace Striker
13. Tank Battle
14. Traxx
15. Wacky Waiters
16. Zor

## Final Thoughts:

1. These videos were recorded during my Christmas and New Year's vacation. I extend my holiday vacations to enjoy and share these types of projects. Playing with THEVIC20 during the holidays created great retro-computing memories.
2. Had THEVIC20 not included a keyboard, many of these VIC-20 games would be frustrating to play. This might explain one of the reasons, other than hardware, why the VIC-20 emulator is not included on [THEC64 mini](https://amzn.to/38lAmQB).
3. As many have stated, there are better games that should take carousel space. I'm sure there are reasons why Retro Games included these are likely cost and copyright. They can't just grab games and throw them on the system or they immediately open themselves up to possible legal action. Don't buy these systems based on the games included.

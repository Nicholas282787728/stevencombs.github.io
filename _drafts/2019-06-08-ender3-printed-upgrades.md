In [my last 3D printing post](linkhere) I journaled my experience setting up my new Creality Ender-3 and producing my first print. The next step in my 3D Printer journey was to begin printing upgrades. This post will capture those upgrades. I will update this post regularly. I decided to print each upgrade using [MIKA3D black PLA](https://amzn.to/2IecWi0) so the objects would seamlessly blend in with the original design.

# Printing preparation
Before I share the 3D printed upgrades, I feel I should share my process to prepare each print for the [Creality Ender-3 printer](https://amzn.to/2EL2hKE). I am using Ubuntu Linux on an older Intel i5 based computer and the [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software) software but no matter your PC setup, the steps below should be similar:

1. Connect the Creality Ender-3 microSD to a PC
1. Find a model to use on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (yes there are other locations, but this seemed to be the most robust location).
1. Download the .zip file that contains the model to an easily accessible location (I created a folder that was backed up on Google Drive so I have an archive of all my files in case I need to reprint)
1. Extract the .zip archive to reveal the folder containing all contents (at this point, I delete the archive file because I am only looking for a single .stl file)
1. Locate the .stl file (will be in the *file* folder)
1. Open the .stl file in Cura and ensure Cura has the proper 3D printer profile selected (a topic for another post maybe, but lots of info with a Google Search and honestly, if it's the first time you've fired up Cura, it should step you through the process)
1. Select the quality of the print (*normal* should be sufficient, but at least for one model below that included knurling, I chose *fine*.)
1. Choose the slice button to prepare the model
1. Download the new .gcode file to the microSD card (I save directly to the card, but you can also save to the PC and then copy it)
1. Eject the microSD card from the PC
1. Place the microSD card in the 3D printer
2. Turn on the 3D printer
3. Select ..........

# Controller fan cover
The first print recommended by most is a cover for the controller fan at the front of the printer. Why? Because if you aren't careful, you could have material run out of the extruder and into the fan. Plus the cover I choose also gave the controller board a cool retro look.

# Extruder knob
There were several extruder knobs available, but I was looking for something small. The one chosen has some additional features that looked interesting to include knurling.

There were tiny holes on the knob that included excess material. I used one of the small Allen wrenches included with the 3D printer to clean out the holes.

{UPDATE: I may try another. This one will suffice for now, but the quality of the top is a bit rough. Not enough to make me print another now though.}

# Display back cover plate
The control panel's electronics are exposed behind the panel. It's not a big issue, you you do find your hand occassionally underneath when you push the controller button. This plate is unique in that you can use the factpr screws included. Some designs require new, longer, screws.

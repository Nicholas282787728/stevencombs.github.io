At the end of September, Apple announced their new [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/). I watched the announcement and found myself very intrigued by the device; however, one thing kept nagging me. I can’t remember the last time I wore a watch on a regular basis. I think it was in the mid 1990s. After that period I only wore a watch whenever I put on my uniform for military duty – a required equipment for operational and training events.

The Apple Watch looks very cool and appears to provide some interesting functionality, but if I’m not going to enjoy wearing a watch, I can’t see shelling out over $350 for one. Enter Pebble.

I won’t go into Pebble’s Kickstarter history, [you can read that yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)#History); however, as a tech geek I’ve "watched" (see what I did there?) their development and have been intrigued since the beginning. I had almost made a purchase several times; however, I couldn’t get past the $150 price tag. It’s a watch made of plastic with a plastic band and as I’ve stated before, I haven’t worn a watch in years. I just pull my iPhone out when I need a time check or look at my computer.

Soon after the Apple Watch announcement, Pebble made a very strategic move and dropped the price of their entry level [Pebble watch to $99](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKEQBI0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BKEQBI0&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20). Given I had interest in the Apple Watch and there was now a new lower price tag of the Pebble, it seemed that now was a good time to give a smart watch a try. This will allow me to inexpensively determine if I will wear a watch full-time again and if the additional functionality beyond time and date is of value to my everyday usage and workflow. I’ve had my Pebble about a month now and decided to share some initial thoughts for others who may consider a purchase. I will present my thoughts from the perspective of an iPhone user. Android users will have a bit different experience and if you do use an Android phone, I recommend you find a review from an Android perspective.

# It’s a watch
The Pebble is a watch and really good one at that. Even without connectivity to the iPhone (more on that in the next section), it’s a pretty cool watch in both appearance and function. Take the recent image I posted on Facebook below:

![Pebble celebrates Halloween](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t31.0-8/q83/s960x960/10620492_10152789719678839_828209333834264136_o.jpg)

The first cool feature is the ability to modify the watch face to fit your mood, style or occasion. Other features that some watchfaces include are:

**Without iPhone connectivity**

* Time
* Date
* Images/graphics
* Text

**With iPhone connectivity**

* Battery life
* iPhone battery life
* iPhone signal strength
* Weather
* News updates

This is a simple list of options that I have noticed in my short time with the Pebble. I am sure there are many more.

# How it works

By itself, the Pebble is a basic watch with a few advanced time related features and an [eInk display](http://www.eink.com/display_products.html). Add an iPhone and the Pebble becomes something else — an amazing notification center on your wrist. Let me put that in perspective. A watch by itself is a notification center. Traditional watches notify you of the time and date and some even provide notification of chronometer progress and alarms to wake you. The Pebble takes those basic watch features and adds a selection of limitless notifications. If your iPhone can notify you (via the [notification center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_Center) built into the iPhone), so can the Pebble and that’s the power of connecting the two. 

In a sense, the Pebble is the ultimate notification center. Notifications come not only in the way of a visual indication, but also through vibration. The vibration is critical to ensure you are made aware of incoming notifications and is very effective. I’ve yet to miss and important notification. When a notification does arrive, it takes over the screen to provide textual information. Not only are you made aware of iPhone notifications, in most instances you can view a summary of the notification. A simple push of a button clears the notification from the watch and returns the selected watch face.

Notifications are received via the bluetooth connectivity to the iPhone. This is a low energy connection. Initially I thought this connectivity would require a serious hit to my iPhone battery life. I’ve found over time that this isn’t the case. Beyond notification, this bluetooth connectivity is also used to transfer apps, watchfaces and firmware updates to the watch. Because the connection is via Bluetooth, you need to be within thirty feet of your iPhone and it must be turned on. When you leave that thirty foot range, the Pebble will shake to let you know you are out of range and the Pebble is now simply a watch.

I quickly mentioned apps and watchfaces. If you want to add functionality beyond just notifications, then you install apps and watchfaces to the Pebble. This is done through the [Pebble app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartwatch+-for-pebble/id711357931?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l9vL) as shown in the image below.

![Pebble iPhone app](http://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2014-10-19-my-first-week-with-pebble-smartwatch/pebble-iphone-app.png)

As you can see in the image above, the app has two area. The apps and watchfaces on the Pebble at the top and the locker on the bottom. The locker is a holding place for all your favorite apps. The current generation of Pebbles can only hold 8 apps or watchfaces due to memory limitations. The locker makes this a bit bearable and ensures you have quick access to the favorite apps not on your Pebble. Transfers are quick. Select the app or watch face and select the load option. The app or watch face will quickly load via Bluetooth to the iPhone and the progress represented by a vertical green bar that rises from bottom to top as shown in the image below.

![Loading a Pebble watch face](http://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2014-10-19-my-first-week-with-pebble-smartwatch/loading-watchface.png)

These are very small applications and load very quickly. Want to remove an app from the Pebble? Select the app from the iPhone app and choose the trash button. It is immediately removed and a slot is free for another app or watch face. This is a quick and simple process.

Operation of the Pebble comes from the use of four buttons. **The Pebble is not a touch screen device**.

Now that we know how the watch operates, let’s look at the good and the bad of the watch.

# The good

* eInk technology
* battery life
* locate your iPhone
* iPhone phone notification
* regular software and firmware upgrades. 2 in the month I’ve owned
* Quick glance of notifications in meetings or car
* Comfortable (kind of amazed) and never notice that it is on my wrist until a notification arrives.

* iPhone replaced my Fitbit

# The bad

Would be great if we didn’t need the phone, but we just aren’t there technologically yet. Even the much lauded Apple Watch will require iPhone connectivity.

* Android phone owners have many more app/feature options due to the open nature of Android operating system
* Two-way communication is lacking due to nature iOS
* Only 8 slots for apps and watchfaces (next version more???)

# Apps and watchfaces I use

I’ve been mucking around in the Pebble App store and these are the apps I currently use or find intriguing:

* Evernote - access to notes on the Pebble can be a bit tedious. It is often easier to simply break out my iPhone; however, you cannot deny the cool factor of bringing up a note on your watch and if you plan accordingly, you can create a workflow that makes frequently used notes easily accessible. For instance, I use a feature that allows a long press of the down button on the right-hand side to quickly load the Evernote Pebble app. I then set the Evernote Pebble app display my shortcuts upon startup.

[You really need a Pebble](https://www.amazon.com/Pebble-Smartwatch-iPhone-Android-Black/dp/B00BKEQBI0/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=bricinmypockb-20&linkCode=w01&linkId=OPRZEIOTB3DUMUE4&creativeASIN=B00BKEQBI0) and the [Pebble](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartwatch+-for-pebble/id711357931?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l9vL) app to explore the many additional capabilities of the watch. And it is a blast when you find a really cool app or watch face.

# Summing up

I plan to continue the use of my Pebble. I’ve become fond of the watch and have found it very convenient while in meetings or driving. Instead looking for my phone in a jacket pocket, I simply glance at my wrist to see “what’s up.”

My use of the Pebble has made my want for an Apple Watch subside for now. Granted the Pebble is not as glamours or probably as well made as the Apple Watch, but at $250 less (and that’s for the basic model), it is much more affordable. With the Apple Watch I worry about battery life, weight and drain on iPhone battery life. My thought is that the Apple Watch will be a better product in its second iteration and possibly cheaper. Who knows though; once the watch is released into the wild and we see actual reviews, I may be intrigued again. 

For now, I have a Pebble. The [Pebble Steel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVX0XGO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00IVX0XGO&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20) is an attractive solution and very well could be my next smart watch when version 2 arrives. Given the numerous firmware/software updates, I anticipate even greater functionality for all Pebble devices and look forward to seeing what comes next. I also can’t help but wonder if iOS 8 and the extensions feature won’t bring even more capabilities to the Pebble platform.

In conclusion, if the thought of a smart watch appeals to you, my guess is the Pebble is your best choice. At its current price point and capabilities, it is a great way to determine if a smart watch fits your lifestyle. I would even suggest that if you aren’t interested in the advanced features of the watch, the Pebble as a watch isn’t even a bad choice. Changing watchfaces on a whim and having quick access to notifications alone make this device a win. For those of us that are bit more technologically sophisticated (read…"geeky"), the apps are just icing on the cake.

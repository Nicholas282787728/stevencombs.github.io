In this Commodore Plus/4 retroCombs episode, I cover chapter 3 in the user's manual entitled, _Using Software_.

## Series Information

This episode is part of a series. You can read the entire series and view additional resources at:

## User's Manual

As part of my Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 manual. I've taken the time to scan each chapter so you can read and follow along. Use the link below for this episode's chapter:

[Chapter 3 - Using Software](https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-3.pdf)

1. [Front Matter](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-title-introduction.pdf)
2. [Chapter 1 - Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-1.pdf)
3. [Chapter 2 - Using the Keyboard and the Screen](https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-2.pdf)

## YouTube Video: _retroCombs: Commodore Plus/4, Chapter 3, Using Software_

In the video below, I work through Chapter 3 of the user's manual and instead of using old school devices like a datasette and disk drive, I use a new Pi1541.

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:
hat
Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`‚á™`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`‚åÉ`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`‚éã`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`‚åÇ`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`‚å´`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`‚èé`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`‚áß`  | Shift         |      |

## Previous Episode Errata

Watcher, ????, shared why I was having issues with characters and cursor movements in the previous video. It is something he called, ???. I looked ahead and we will actually learn about this in the next chapter!

## Episode Contents

In this episode I describe and demonstrate each of the items below:

1. "The family of software available...is growing quickly?"
2. Plus/4 can use cartridge, cassette tape, or diskette. Use the cassette or diskette to create and store your own programs.
3. Also includes four built-in software packages (more in future episodes). Simply press the F1 key ([see last episode](/plus4-3)).
4. Cartridges - Includes a variety of personal, education, business and games software. The only cartridge I have is this diagnostic cart from TFW8B.com. Let's try it:

    * Turn off Plus/4
    * Insert cartridge (label facing up)
    * Turn on Plus/4

5. Cassettes ([Commodore 1531](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Commodore_1531)) - "These tapes are similar to music cassettes." While other computers could use a cassette player, the Commodore uses their own "datasette." Use the datasette to create and store your own programs. We will use a C2N datasette for VIC-20 and a Tapduino (later). Let's use the datasette to load and save programs.

    Load a program on cassette:

    * Insert a cassette into datasette
    * Rewind tape to beginning (or FFW or RW to a time code)
    * Type `LOAD` and press `‚èé`. The computer will display:

        `PRESS PLAY ON TAPE`

    * Press the play button on the datasette and the screen will go blank followed by the following:

        `FOUND "program name`

    * Press `C=` to load the program or else wait 10 seconds for the program to be loaded automatically.
    * When the program is loaded, `READY` will appear. type `RUN` to run the program. If the program is a basic program, you can use the `LIST` command to view and modify.

    Save a program on cassette:

    * Insert a cassette into datasette
    * Rewind tape to beginning (or FFW or RW to a time code)
    * Type `SAVE "program name` (alpha-numeric up to 16 characters and you can get creative with upper-lower case modes) and press `‚èé`. The computer will display:

        `PRESS RECORD AND PLAY ON TAPE`

    * The screen will blank and when the program is saved, will display `READY`.

    > For both the `LOAD` and `SAVE` command, you press `RS` to stop the process. For `SAVE`, press `RS` first then press stop on the datasette.

6. Diskette ([Commodore 1551](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Commodore_1551) that was parallel rather than serial like the 1541/81. Format was not backward capatible - Uses a 5¬º inch diskette üíæ to load and save programs. Let's give it a try:

    Load a program on diskette:

    * Insert a diskette into disk drive and close the protective door.
    * Type `DLOAD "PRGRAM NAME` or `F2` followed by the program name and press `‚èé`.

    > I believe the DSAVE, DLOAD, and DIRECTORY commands were added with the Commodore 128. The old muscle memory remembers, `LOAD "FILENAME",8,1`

    * The screen will display the following:

        ```
        SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME

        LOADING

        READY

        ‚ñà
        ```

    * When the program is loaded, `READY` will appear. type `RUN` to run the program. If the program is a basic program, you can use the `LIST` command to view and modify.

    Display directory of a diskette:

    * Insert a diskette into the disk drive
    * Type `DIRECTORY` and press `‚èé`. The computer will display:

        `???`

    Save a program to disk drive:

    * Insert a diskette into the disk drive
    * Type `DSAVE "program name` (same name constraints as tape) and press `‚èé`. The computer will display:

        `???`

    * The screen will blank and when the program is saved, will display `READY`.

## Random Thoughts

In preparation for this episode, I had to assemble the Pi1541. That in itself was a post and a video. You can check it out here. I really wanted to demonstrate the use of a disk drive and a datasette as part of this video.

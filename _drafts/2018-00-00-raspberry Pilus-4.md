One day I will blog post about my first experiences with Commodore computers. For now, I want to share the results of my latest project; the conversion of a Commodore Plus/4 case and keyboard into what I am calling the Raspberry Pilus/4. This was not an overnight project and tooks some time to complete. The majority of the time was spent waiting for products to ship from Europe.

# Build List
1. [Commodore Plus/4 case with keyboard](1)
2. [TME DS1020-18RT1D - Connector: FFC (FPC); angled 90°; PIN:18](2)
3. [Individual Computers Keyrah V2](3)

# Secret Sauce - The Keyrah V2

While I appreciate Individual Computers’ production of the Keyrah V2, there are no detailed instructions for installation of the device into a Commodore Plus/4. While you can find many projects that use the device inside other Commodore computers such as the C-64, VIC-20, and various AMIGA models, a little know addition to the Keyrah allows the use of the device inside a Plus/4 and a C-16. The instructions I provide will take some of the mystery out of this process.

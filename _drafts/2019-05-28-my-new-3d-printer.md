I purchased my first 3D Printer over the 2019 Memorial Day weekend. I've been researching 3D Printers for over 18 months and found it difficult to choose a brand and model. I did have certain criteria:

* Affordable (under $200)
* Popular printer with a large community of users
* Upgradeable (both hardware and software)
* Large-ish print bed
* Compatible with Octoprint
* Heated bed
* Easy to assemble
* Well reviewed
* Produced moderately good prints

While browsing 3D printers at Amazon, I found the [Creality Ender-3 for $229 with a $40 coupon code](https://amzn.to/2Wt0i7O). It met my first criteria. This was not the Ender-3 Pro. However, that model was currently more than $200 and after a review of comparisons, there wasn't enough value in the Pro version to justify the extra cost. The Ender-3 also met everyone one of my other criteria based on online reviews. The remainder of this post will be my experience assembling the printer, all the way to first print. It will be in journal format with date and time. Let's get to it:

## Day 1: 11:10 - Draft the blog post
Blog post draft in SublimeText ready (you are reading it). Time to break open the Creality box and see what's inside.

First item out of the box is the poorly translated assembly instructions. Images are well done and I should be able to assemble using these instructions. If not, I'm sure there's a YouTube video that can help. Each item has an associated number. I will use these numbers as a reference in this post.

First thing I noticed, and a bit disappointing, is the Ender-3 does not include the magnetic build plate. It is removable, but is held down with the included binder clips. Online sources reveal not having the magnetic version found in the Pro pack may be a good thing. Seems heat transfer is an issue.

### 11:27
Not sure which items to pull out of the box first, so started with the control display component. There is protective covering on the LCD panel. All-in-all, the printer seems well packaged for shipping. I do not anticipate any issues due to shipping.

### 11:31
Now I'm really confused. Not sure what to take out of the box next so I am working my way around the small things first and in this order:

1. Control Display (as mentioned above) - Part 01
2. Support rails - Part 19
3. Base unit - Part 02 (Which is a bit confusing because there are a whole bunch of wires and the print head connected to this base. Be VERY careful removing it from the box and make sure you don't tug on anything.)
4. Print head servo assembly - Part 06 (This thing is a beast! All metal assembly. So glad I chose this over the Prusia i8 variants.)
5. Power supply - Part 03 (Another reason to choose the Ender-3 is the 24v power supply. Other under $200 models often include a 12v supply. 24v should ensure better heating with power to spare for mechanicals.)


### 11:46
Removed the first layer packaging to reveal another layers of items. Items on the second layer include:

1. Power cord - Item 13
2. Spool holder - Item 11
3. Servo motor - Item 08
4. Putty knife - No item number of part of the tools package included
5. Vertical screw - Item 16 (Nice touch to include in protective tube.)
6. Vertical rails - Items 15 and 16
7. Material Spool - Item 10
8. Z axis limit switch - Item 9 (next items are included in the same bag.)
9. Roller assembly - Item 07
10. Spare print head and tubing materials
11. Small sample of PLA material (not sure there's enough here to print anything. No worries though, I purchased [three spools of red, black and white PLA](https://amzn.to/2EPqks7) for $33 with a 5% off coupon.)
12. 8Gb Micro USB card with USB adapter (SDCARD includes many resources, users guides, video and sample STL files. First thing I did was copy them all to a Google Drive folder for a backup. I'm glad I spent time reviewing the contents. There are several different assembly instruction PDFs as well as a video. Those will prove to be handy when I begin assembly.)
13. Roller guide - Item 04 (the next items are included in one last package of goodies.)
14. Snip (Very sharp and will be handy during both assembly and when cleaning off support material from prints.)
15. Zip ties (Cable management.)
16. Tool to clean out print head (I think.)
17. M5 Nuts
18. Support end covers
19. Spool holder plastic nut
20. 5 Allen wrenches
21. Two open end wrenches
22. Small screwdriver
23. 3 M4x20 screws
24. 6 M4x16 screws with washers and nuts
25. 6 M5x45 screws with washers
26. 2 M4x14 screws with spanning nuts
27. 5 M5x8 screws
28. 2 m4x18 screws6 M5x25 screws with lock washers
29. 1 tractor belt

Whew! And that completes removal of all parts and cataloging. Time: 12:18. Lunch time!

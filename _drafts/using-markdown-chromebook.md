This section won't be for everyone; however, if you are a markdown and/or Jekyll blog fan, you may get a bit frustrated using a Chromebook. That is unless you have the right apps.

# Markdown
There are several markdown editors for the Chromebook. Many of them are web based as you would expect. However there are a few pretty nice markdown editors. My top three are:

* StackEdit
* Minimalist Markdown
* Marxico

The editor you choose will likely be based on the type of storage solution you need, that is, Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote  or local.

# Jekyll

StackEdit is your only option. Or my post from an iPad solution.

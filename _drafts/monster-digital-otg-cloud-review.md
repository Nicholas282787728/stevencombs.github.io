This post should be titled, Monster Digital OTG Cloud: Jack of all trades, master of none; however, the title while appropriate, was a bit unweildly. Even the name of the device reveals a product that isn't quite sure what it is. Before I begin with my thoughts on this device, take a look at the promotional video below for Monster's own take on this device's capabilities:

# How could I resist?

I found the Monster Digital OTG Cloud (OTG) at Sam's Club and it was truely an impulse buy. But how could I resist a device that claimed to be a:

* cloud file server.
* SD, microSD card reader.
* USB drive reader.
* Wi-Fi router.
* Wi-Fi extender.
* battery charger.

Not only was it featured packed, Sam's Club had the device, with an MSRP of $99, at a rock bottom prices of $14.15. If only one feature worked, this would be a valuable addition to my gadget bag.

I'm unsure why the OTG is at such a markdown. Even on Amazon, the price has been significantly reduced from it's MSRP [to around $30](https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Digital-Cloud-Memory-WCRD3-0000-A/dp/B00O1O4GDS/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=bricinmypockb-20&linkCode=w01&linkId=3Y6Y4VJC3WQ74TPH&creativeASIN=B00O1O4GDS). Amazon reviewers also give this device mixed reviews. Even so, at these prices, the device could be a valuable addition if you have high tech savy.

# What you get

For your money, you get a couple of items:

* USB cable
* 8Gb microSD with SD adapter
* Instructions
* OTG Cloud

At $14, the USB cable and 8Gb microSD card practially pay for the device. Noteibly absent are a case and power supply. But again, at this price, it is not expected.

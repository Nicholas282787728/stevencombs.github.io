## Series Information

This episode is part of a series. You can check the entire series and additional resources at:

## User's Manual

As part of my Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 manual. I've taken the time to scan each chapter so you can read and follow along. Use the link below for this episode's chapter:

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`‚á™`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`‚åÉ`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`‚éã`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`‚åÇ`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`‚å´`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`‚èé`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`‚áß`  | Shift         |      |

## Episode Contents

In this episode I describe and demonstrate each of the items below:

1. Upper-case -vs- lower-case mode: Default is upper-case graphics mode. Switch between them with `‚áß` + `C=`.

    > **WARNING:** Don't use the ‚áß key when typing basic programs.

2. Run Stop `RS`: Stops a running program. `‚áß` + `RS` loads and runs the first program program on a disk drive

    > **TIP:** If there is a program in memory, `‚áß` + `RS` will also fail to load the first program on a disk drive, but will still execute the run command on the code in memory.

3. Cursor Keys: Covered in last episode, but Plus/4 includes all four keys!
4. Clear Home `‚åÇ`: Home, clear, and clear window functions. Home moves the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen (home). `‚áß` + `‚åÇ` move to cursor to the home and clears the screen. 2 x `‚åÇ` Clears the main and other windows (more on windowing in chapter 4)
5. Control `‚åÉ`: Works with other keys that we will learn throughout this series. `‚åÉ` + S will pausing printing (!) and listing of a program. Any key resumes the listing.
6. Commodore Key `C=`: Work with other keys. `C=` shift key for the left graphic characters on the keys, the bottom row of colors on the top number keys, and will slow down program scrolling.
7. Color Controls:

    * `‚åÉ` + `9` = Reverse On
    * `‚åÉ` + `0` = Reverse Off
    * `‚åÉ` + `,` = Reverse On
    * `‚åÉ` + `.` = Reverse Off


8. Escape Key `‚éã`: Do not use like a shift (`‚áß`) key. Tap `‚éã` and then tap another key as shown below (I'm not covering them all but we will add in future chapters):

    * `‚éã`, `A` = Auto Insert
    * `‚éã`, `C` = Cancel Auto Insert
    * `‚éã`, `D` = Delete Line
    * `‚éã`, `I` = Insert Line
    * `‚éã`, `J` = Move to Beginning of Line
    * `‚éã`, `K` = Move to End of Line
    * `‚éã`, `L` = Screen Scrolling On
    * `‚éã`, `M` = Screen Scrolling Off
    * `‚éã`, `O` = Cancel Insert, Quote (Chapter 4), Reverse, and Flash
    * `‚éã`, `P` = Erase From Position to left
    * `‚éã`, `Q` = Erase from Position to Right
    * `‚éã`, `X` = Cancel an Escape functions


9. Special Keys: Per the manual, the keyboard contains special keys such as: `¬£`, `œÄ`, `<`, `>`, `[`, `]`, `‚Üê`, and `‚Üë`.
10. Function Keys: Type the `KEY` command to display the fuctions of the keys as shown below:

    ```
    KEY 1,"GRAPHIC" or built-in software
    KEY 2,"DLOAD"+ CHR$(34)
    KEY 3,"DIRECTORY"+ CHR$(13)
    KEY 4,"SCNCLR"+ CHR$(13)
    KEY 5, "DSAVE"+ CHR$(34)
    KEY 6,"RUN"+ CHR$(13)
    KEY 7, "LIST"+ CHR$(13)
    KEY 8, "HELP"+ CHR$(13)
    ```
    I demonstrate each function key.

    > **TIP:** CHR$(34) = `"` and CHR$(13) = `‚èé`

    Function Keys `F4`, `F5`, `F6`, and `F7` require `‚áß` and you can reprogram the keys as I demonstrate. A soft reset will retain the reprogramming and a hard reset will clear the reprogramming.

## Random Thoughts

I can't believe I learned so much about this computer just by reviewing the use of the keyboard.

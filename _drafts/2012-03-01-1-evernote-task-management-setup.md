You can replicate the majority of my system using the free version of Evernote so there's no reason to not give this a shot if you are struggling to get organized. Below you will find step by step instructions to recreate my Evernote task management system.

# Setup
!Task notebook

Reminders only in !Tasks notebook

Create a !Tasks shortcut and sync across all devices

My system does not use a note that contains a list, which I actually did try and that system failed. My guess is that many have tried to use Evernote as a task management system using this technique; however, this fails on many levels. For instance, using this method, on the list can contain a reminder, not each individual task. Also, the list become unwieldy and not easy to sort.

Creating a note for every individual tasks also allows me to turn a task into a project. For instance, this blog post started out as a simple to do. Within the note I began to capture my thoughts about what would be included in this blog post.

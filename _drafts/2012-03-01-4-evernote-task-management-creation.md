In our previous posts we have setup the [Evernote Task Management System (ETMS)](InsertULR) and [created a *Tasks* notebook](InsertURL). If you are just joining us, I recommend you read those two previous posts. Its now time to start managing our tasks and begin to get some work done.

## Task List View
In the previous post, I shared the image below:

![Task management list](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZM666NC5aDU/VPtPXQ_DVtI/AAAAAAABZ40/b8cyo5f9vCk/w1280-h720-no/List%2Bfrom%2Bindividual%2Btasks.png)

At the top you see an item that says, *Add a reminder to Tasks*. You can use this area to capture tasks. Let’s give this a shot:

1. Using the mouse, click on the *Add a reminder to Tasks* area. A cursor will appear.
3. In the *Add a reminder to Tasks* area, type `Create blog post outline`
2. Press the `Enter` ↩ key.

Evernote creates a new note that includes an undated reminder and presents this note so that you can add additional information to task, set a due date, and/or add tags. This is shown in the image below.

Here’s where the fun begins; as well as the application of the Getting Things Done (GTD) method.

# Apply GTD concepts
You now know how to create a single task and now understand that the task created is an individual note, not part of a list of tasks on a single note. The power is that now we can use this individual note to apply GTD concepts.

I will not cover the GTD method in this post and I assume you have some familiarity with the system. If you don’t, I recommend you read [Allen’s book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142000280&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20&linkId=EQFSZW2WSX4HYXI3) book or find one of thousands of blog posts online that provide a primer to the GTD system. I will simply show you how to apply the concepts and briefly touch on what they do.

Let’s start with the reminder that was automatically generated. Yes, the task has a reminder; however, there is no due date. It is simply a tag used by Evernote to identify this note as a task. Let’s add a due date.





Daily emails




## Manual creation using a new note
Create a note and then tag it appropriately and move to !Task folder
Items with dates and items without dates (click reminder icon)
Send tasks from inbox via email (discuss tags to categorize and add due dates)

Using this process will allow you to add notes to your task such as phone numbers addresses delegates etc. You can also use this note to include items such as PDF files sound files are Nicole's office documents etc. that will assist you in the task completion.

## Web browser
My tasks often include reading material,or review of articles I find online. I can easily add PDF files or use the Evernote web clipper to add these to my task list.

## Email
evernote address
tag for notebook (!Tasks), due date (!20150101), and tag (#personal/#work/etc…)  - what’s the order that works?

# Tags
Create your own tags however here are some recommendations
@this
@that
>delegate
Evernote remembers tags and they become easy to add via a drop down list.

# Mobile
Add items directly from the iPhone home screen
Use voice input to quickly capture your task

Premium with offline sync allows me to manage tasks even when I am not online. I sync my !Tasks notebook on both my iPhone and iPad.

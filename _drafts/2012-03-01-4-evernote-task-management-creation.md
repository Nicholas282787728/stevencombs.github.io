## Manual creation in Evernote using Reminders
Enter an item in the Reminders area at the top of the !Tasks list

## Manual creation using a new note
Create a note and then tag it appropriately and move to !Task folder
Items with dates and items without dates (click reminder icon)
Send tasks from inbox via email (discuss tags to categorize and add due dates)

Using this process will allow you to add notes to your task such as phone numbers addresses delegates etc. You can also use this note to include items such as PDF files sound files are Nicole's office documents etc. that will assist you in the task completion.

## Web browser
My tasks often include reading material,or review of articles I find online. I can easily add PDF files or use the Evernote web clipper to add these to my task list.

## Email
evernote address
tag for notebook (!Tasks), due date (!20150101), and tag (#personal/#work/etc…)  - what’s the order that works?

# Tags
Create your own tags however here are some recommendations
@this
@that
>delegate
Evernote remembers tags and they become easy to add via a drop down list.

# Mobile
Add items directly from the iPhone home screen
Use voice input to quickly capture your task

Premium with offline sync allows me to manage tasks even when I am not online. I sync my !Tasks notebook on both my iPhone and iPad.

I'm beginning a new series of short YouTube videos about the Commodore Plus/4. In preparation of that series, it was time to create a video bumper (short 10 second, or so, brand animation to introduce all videos). In this post, I'm going to share my process. This is not a step-by-step tutorial, but rather a description of the tools I used and the flow to put it all together. Let's take a look at the bumper first in the YouTube video below.


## YouTube Video: _retroCombs Animated Video Bumper_

As you watch the video below, see if you can identify which tool I used. I think my list, of all FREE apps, will surprise you.

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVw_ZBVBk7g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></p></div>

Think you've identified the tools? Let's see if you were correct.

# Creating the Artwork (Google Slides)

This one is going to confuse a whole bunch of graphic artists out there. Every graphic I create for [my YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/stevencombs) or [my podcast](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com) is created in...wait for it...[Google Slides](https://slides.google.com). You can view the Google Slides file that contains the artwork for this bumper video below.

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><p><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRgeny5Agaj9kGu7xkIs-bNLQi8zEzlvpCtfGhnxfnMoO4VvygFv_RjAQCk_jSG3asy6IFx1IiqAiyy/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;></iframe></p></div>

This is a live file, meaning, as I add additional graphics, you can always return to this page and see the additions. Being able to embed a presentation is the first advantage of Google Slides.

You may be wondering why I use Google Slides instead of Google Drawings. Easy answer. Every tool included in Google Drawings is also included as a standard tool in Google Slides and Google Drawing can only contain a single drawing, not a series of drawings as I demonstrate in my presentation above. Having multiple slides means I can easily duplicate a slide to transfer the color palette, copy portions of images from one slide to the next, and collect a series of images into a single file.

I'm beginning a new series of YouTube videos about the Commodore Plus/4. In preparation of that series, I wanted to create a video bumper; a short 10 second, or so, brand animation to introduce all videos. In this post, I'm going to share my process. This post is not a step-by-step tutorial, but rather a description of the tools I used and the flow to put it all together. Let's take a look at the bumper first in the YouTube video below.


## YouTube Video: _retroCombs Animated Video Bumper_

As you watch the video below, see if you can identify which tool I used to create the bumper. I think my list, of all FREE apps, will surprise you.

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVw_ZBVBk7g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></p></div>

Think you've identified the tools? Let's see if you were correct.

## Creating the Artwork (Google Slides)

This one is going to confuse a whole bunch of graphic artists out there. Every graphic I create for [my YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/stevencombs) or [my podcast](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com) is created in...wait for it...[Google Slides](https://slides.google.com). You can view the Google Slides file that contains the artwork for this bumper video below.

This is a live file, meaning, as I add additional graphics, you can always return to this page and see the additions. Being able to embed a presentation is the first advantage of Google Slides.

You may wonder why I use Google Slides instead of Google Drawings. Easy answer. Every tool included in Google Drawings is also included as a standard tool in Google Slides and Google Drawing can only contain a single drawing, not a series of drawings as I demonstrate in my presentation above. Having multiple slides means I can easily duplicate a slide to transfer the color palette, copy portions of images from one slide to the next, and collect a series of images into a single file.

You will notice in my bumper that the monitor and the computer are surprisingly similar to a Commodore monitor and the Plus/4, but not quite. I created these images by tracing over photos I took for the actual objects and then modified them to fit the tools I could find in Google Slides. If you look closely, you will see some of the liberties I tooks and that was okay. These images do not need to be exact.

The drawings created in Google Slides are vector images. As a computer-aided drafting major, I'm more familiar with the much more flexible vector, rather than bitmap, drawing tools and feel right at home in Google Slides. The nice thing about Google Slides is that I can combine bitmap with vector graphics, but I rarely do  as I much prefer the look of vector images for my projects. I create each unique drawing on its own slide and if I want to combine items to make a system, I copy and paste onto another new slide.

Before I begin creating video assets, I always specify the size of the presentation in pixels. Since I work in HD, I set the presentation dimensions to 1280 x 1080 pixels. There's an option in Google Slides to chose standard 16 by 9 HD, but I've found when exporting images using this setting, I don't get the full HD resolution, but rather a 720P resolution. This does not scale up well in video.

Unfortunately, there are some tools missing from Google Slides that I wish were included. While I appreciate the export options in Google Slides, one of the options missing is any kind of export presentation as a movie or animation file. So that means I have to use another tool to create my animation.

## Creating the Animation (Apple Keynote)

If you've ever seen an Apple keynote presentation, you've experienced the graphic and animation capabilities of the Keynote application. I created my bumper animation using all Keynote tools.

One thing I had to do was grab the same font I use in Google Slides and install on my Mac mini. Luckily, Google makes this easy. Visit the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) site, download the font, and double-click to install on the Mac. The font I'm using is a fun 8-bit style font called, [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?query=Press).

Once the font was installed, I used the standard keynote animation tools. I didn't use any slide transitions. The entire animation was created using object animations. One particularly fund animation was keyboard. This animation mimics typing. Using this animation with the Press Start 2P font, on a blue background, allowed me to simulate typing on a familiar 8-bit computer. I think it looks really good.

At this point, I could have chosen to also include audio to simulate the sound of someone typing; however, I new I would have more control over this in a video editor. I also wanted to have the actual sound of typing rather than a simulation.

## Creating the Audio (Audacity and Recording Device)

To record actual keystrokes, I broke out an [inexpensive handheld audio recorder](https://amzn.to/2yy47ig), connected [a lavalier microphone](https://amzn.to/3ei5L6z), clipped the microphone to the top of a Commodore Plus/4. I then tried to type, at the same speed, what was being animated in Keynote. That was a disaster. I kept messing up. I counted the characters. Then I simply made it up and after the final key, struck the return key firmly to give it that extra "umpf" at the end of the line. I did this several times in the same audio file until I felt I had a good take.

I also wanted some 8-bit sound effects. I found some 8-bit sound effects in several YouTube videos. I used an online YouTube to MP3 converter to download just the sound from these videos. Now that I had my audio files, It was time to grab the audio I needed and create individual files I would later drop into the video editor. I used Audacity to create these individual sound clips from the larger files.

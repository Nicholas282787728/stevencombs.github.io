Growing up I was a huge fan of the [DC comics](http://www.dccomics.com/) superheroes. My old comic book collection from my childhood verify this statement. The majority of the books in the collection are from DC comics with my favorites being Superman, Batman, Flash and Green Lantern. My absolute favorites however, where superhero teams such as the Justice League, Justice Society and the Legion of Superheroes. 

Growing up I would watch any cartoon that involved the DC heroes. When the [Super Friends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends) hit the airwaves, I was remember being very excited as I would finally see a DC superhero team together on TV. 

I never imaged those many years ago that I would see live action versions of some of my favorite DC heroes.

# Arrow
In its third season, as of this writing, Arrow is currently the gold standard for DC superhero television.

# Flash


# Gotham
Letâ€™s move away from the CW version of the DC universe now. The first new DC shot to hit this fall season was [Gotham](http://www.fox.com/gotham/) on Fox.

# Constantine

Unlike the 2005 Keanu Reeves version of the John Constantine character, the NBC version will rely much more heavily on the source material.

It's time. Time to purge my life of iOS tablet devices. I've been using an iPad for the entire 10 years of the devices life and have moved from an original iPad to a 9.7 inch iPad Pro. I've not used an iOS phone for over five years and I am ready to move to a tablet that used either pure Android or Chrome OS.

This is not an easy proposition. Google stopped making Android tablets years ago, along with Chrome OS tablets last year after they stopped making the Pixel Slate. The most popular tablet running the Android operating systesm are Amazon Fire tablets; however, Amazon tablets are not pure Android and don't have access to the Google Play Store.

My search was a long one. I had very specific requirements and I was almost to the point where I thought I would not find a tablet that meet the majority of the requirements below:

   1. USB-C power adapter
   3. 10 inch or larger HD screen
   4. 4 Gb system memory
   5. 64 Gb storage
   6. Fast processor
   7. Stereo sound
   8. Android 9.0 (10 preferred) or Chrome OS
   9. Excellent batter life

I finally came across the Lenovo Smart Tab Pro with Google Assistant afer the 2019 holiday season. The retail price was $350 but there was a $100 off opportunity when purchased directly from the Lenovo website. Amazon does not offer this device probably because it prominently features the rival Google Assistant.

I began to read the reviews for the device and they were mixed. Some loved the form factor, battery life, sound, and build quality, while others lamented that the processor couldn't run the latest games. Since I am not a gamer, everything else about the device meet the majority of my requirements, not all, but closer than any other tablet I researched.

This post is not a review of this tablet, that will probably come later, but I did take some time to "unbox" the device with video because I found very little information about this device at YouTube or online. You can view that video below:

In a [previous blog post](https://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2020/03/28/unbox-cloner-box-pro.html), I shared my YouTube OPEN THE BOX video on the [Cloner Alliance Cloner Box Pro](https://amzn.to/2UMUOCd). After posting that video, I had several readers and YouTube watchers (well a couple anyway) ask me if I planned a follow-up video. I was torn but decided to give it a try.

I knew the production of this video would push my DaVinci Resolve limits and because of COVID-19, I had time work on the project over the course of a couple of weeks. While preparing the video, I had another idea. Why not try and connect the Cloner Box Pro to a Commodore Plus/4. More on that later.

The video below is my attempt to share my first use of the Cloner Box Pro with the world. Afterward, I have additional afterthoughts on the device and the plans I have for this gadget.

As a reminder, I purchased the Cloner Box Pro because I hope to do the following things with the device:

* Capture Chrome OS live to OBS Studio
* Record Chrome OS tutorials
* Capture video device menus (Roku and Android TV)
* Capture retro computer screens (Commodore 64, VIC-20, etc)

## About that Commodore Plus/4

I had a couple of Commodore computers I could have used for this demonstration. Once was a Commdore VIC 20. I opted not to try this device since it only has a 24 character monitor. I also wanted to try out the Plus/4. You see, I never owned one of those in the past and about six months ago I purchased one on eBay that claimed to be in excellent and almost like new condition. They weren't far from wrong and I was so glad the Plus/4 booted up on the first attempt. Now that I know it works, I have several ideas up my sleeves for those reto computer enthusiasts out there; especially those Commodore fans.

## Final thoughts about the Cloner Box Pro



Drop a comment below and let me know if you use a [ClonerAlliance HDML-Cloner Box Pro](https://amzn.to/2UMUOCd). I'd love to hear from folks who use it in creative ways and with OSB Studio (if that is possible).

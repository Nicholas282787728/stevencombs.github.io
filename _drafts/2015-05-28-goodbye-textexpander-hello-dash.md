For several years [TextExpander](!mas) has been my go to Mac text expansion utility. There was a brief switch to [aText](!mas); however, I came back to TextExpander because it has more polish and better community support. Recently a new version of TextExpander was released (version 5.0). Version 5 includes a new features, most notably the ability to identify and create expansion snippets automatically. For me, this feature did not compel me to purchase the $19.

> **What is a text expansion utility?** It is a utility application that allows you to type a small string of text that automatically expands to a larger string. For instance, I type `itcc` and it expands to `Ivy Tech Community College`as soon as I type hit the space bar. Most text expansion utilities include additional features, but this is the primary use.

There were three separate utilities installed on my Mac that include text expansion capabilities:

1. [TextExpander](!mas)
2. [Alfred](!mas)
3. [Dash](!mas)

I experimented with text expansion using Alfred in the past. It works, but it is less than ideal and it is a laborious process to create expansion snippets. Alfred is best when used as an application/file launcher and search tool.

I also have an installation of Dash installed. Dash includes a code snippets feature; however, I had not tried to use it in the past. Before I dive into my experience using Dash as a text expansion utility, let me provide a synopsis of Dash's primary capabilities.

# About Dash

Below is the official description for Dash:

> Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 150+ APIs (for a full list, see below). You can even generate your own docsets or request docsets to be included.

# Docsets?

For those unfamiliar with programming, think of an API Documentation Browser as a search tool to locate programming commands and concepts within an electronic catalog of user manuals. As an example:

While programming in Python and I cannot remember the proper syntax, usage, scope or options for the `print` command. I use Dash to search the Python docset for the `print` command. Dash will provide the information shown in the image below.

Docsets are not preinstalled. You choose the docsets you need based on the tasks you perform. Once chosen, Dash downloads docsets to your Mac so they are available when you are offline and also checks regularly to see if updates are available. There are over a hundred different docsets that range from Markdown, to Python, to Swift.

# Cheatsheets

Dash also provides access to cheatsheets. I use cheatsheets for [Atom](http://www.atom.io) and [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html). When I forget a keystroke or features in one of these applications, I use Dash to jog my memory. Even better, Dash integrates with Alfred. I use Alfred to perform a search and Dash displays the results.

# Create your own

Docsets and cheatsheets are programming language centric; however, you can also create your own. You could create an email/phone directory for your organization, a list of comic books, or a company procedural manual. Once you create this reference you can then share these personalized docsets or cheatsheets to others. For someone who dabbles in various programming lanaguages such as Python, Ruby and Arduino and writes extensively in Markdown; Dash is a life-saver.

# Text expansion with snippets

So how does this get us back to text expansion? I mentioned earlier that Dash also includes a snippet function. Coders use snippets to store code they reuse or as a reference for a later project. You can use various tools to save snippets, but it really makes sense to save programming snippets in the same tool you use to search docsets. If you find a line or two of code in a docset that you want to reuse, you can highlight it, right-click and save it to your Dash snippets. Dash will sync all snippets and dockets to all your Macs.

Snippet insertion into other applications, such as [Atom](http://www.atom.io) or [CodeRunner](!mas), is done by the use of an abbreviation. For instance, you want to insert the line of code below into Atom.

``` Python
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.
     if len(w) > 6:
     words.insert(0, w)
```

Instead of copying and pasting this template for a Python list, you instead assign a snippet abbreviation such as:

`,,pylist`

Notice the two `,,` before the abbreviation `pylist`. These characters ensure you don't accidentally type the abbreviation but require you to be more intentional. Not required, but a good practice.

Snippets don't have to be lines of code though. When Dash is running, expansion of the abbreviation to any type of text occurs in any Mac application. For instance, I have the following sample snippets to save keystrokes:

| Abbr.   | Expansion                                              |
|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| wsc     | <http://www.stevencombs.com>                           |
| @@g     | <steven.combs@gmail.com>                               |
| ,,date  | inserts the current date                               |
| ,,green | #006B54 : the college's official green hex code        |
| ,,apple | ï£¿ : because I can never remember the keyboard shortcut |

I currently have around 80 snippets and they work flawlessly in all applications. For general text expansion capabilities, Dash if flawless. Dash even goes further and allows you to organize your snippets using tags making them easy to search for and categorize. Below is a screenshot of Dash that displays the tags I use to keep my snippets organized.

This list grows daily as I find other way to reduce typing.

Android has come a long way in the past several years and during that time, there has been a huge Hatfield and McCoy mentality between Android and iOS users. The only smart phone I have used is the iPhone. Since standing in line for that first version to my latest, the iPhone 5s, I've been firmly in the iOS camp. That changed recently.

When Google announced [Project Fi](https://fi.google.com/), I became curious about [Android version 5.1 (Lollipop)](http://www.androidcentral.com/lollipop), the [Motorola Nexus 6](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R1984DS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00R1984DS&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20) and Google's new wireless network.  I made a request for an invite to Project Fi. I received the invite about a month and a half ago. I immediately accepted and a few days later, the only phone available on that network, the Motorola Nexus 6, arrived on my door step. I've used the Nexus 6 for about two months and decided to make conversion from iOS to Android observations.

# Android Apps
The majority of the Android apps found in the Google Play store are free; however, to get full functionality for many, or to remove annoying ads, you will most likely need to upgrade from a "lite" version to a "pro" version. App prices are in line with those in the iTunes store for those category of apps I use.

# Android user interface (UI)
Versions of Android prior to version 5.0 (Lollipop) were a mess. Version 5.0+ has been updated with [Google material design](!g) specifications. The UI is modern, functional, bold, attractive, flat and colorful. Material design is also found in Chrome OS bringing consistency across the two platforms. I've grown fond of material design and often miss it when I switch back to the iPad.

The problem with material design is that app developers are taking their time to adopt. Most popular apps I use have adopted the design specification, but many smaller titles haven't made the move making Google Play store a mishmash of app design.

iOS app design is also a mixed bag. While many apps look great, they are not consistent in their UI design methodology and a feature in one app may not work the same in another. iOS 8 brought with it a new flatter design, but my preference is Google's material design.

# Launchers

# Stability

# Photo Management

# Camera

Still needs work and is slow. This area is device specific, but on the Nexus 6 you will experience good photos with very high resolution. Below is both an iPhone 5s and a Nexus 6 image shot back to back for comparison.

# Podcast apps
Overcast is my go to Podcast app on iOS. On Android it took some time for me find a competent podcast client and I found it in Pocket Casts. Pocket Casts is very similar in function and design to Overcast. A plus for Android users who also use iOS devices, Pocket Casts is available and syncs between both platforms. Like Overcast, there is also an in sync web service so you can listen to podcasts using the browser.

# Apple device syncing

iTunes - iSyncr
Bookmarks - Chrome
Photos - Google Photos
Notes - Google Keep and/or Evernote

# Android Hardware

This area is very device specific. Unlike the iOS world, Google does not control the hardware except for their Nexus line. I use, and recommend, Nexus 6. Nexus devices have a pure Google Android experience and are normally the first to receive updates. I use the Nexus 6 on Google's Project Fi. As such, I have an entirely pure Android experience from Google. The two together are very innovative. Motorola builds the Nexus 6 and includes features not available in an iPhone such as:

* Wireless charging
* Dual front-facing stereo speakers (more immersive sound)
* 6" Quad HD display (2560x1440 AMOLED)
* Quick charge (6 hours of use from only 15 minutes of charge)
* Multi network SIM (utilize more than one service)
* 4K video camera

Of course there are iOS device features that are not available on the Nexus 6; however, the point is; there is innovation in both spaces.

# Battery life is comparable to iOS devices

Android still has a long way to go to match the battery life of an Apple iOS device. Word is the next major version of Android will address this; however, for now, there is still a lot of room for improvement in this area. There have been several days where I have not been able to make it through the day without topping off the battery. Given the large battery in my Nexus 6, this should not be the case.

#Android OS is open

Android is more open than iOS in some respects; however, Google has locked several features down. To get to these features you have to "root" the device. This process is not for the faint of heart and I do not recommend this for the average user. Due to this, you will find several things you cannot do with tools like Tasker and Automate.

On the flip side, I have found Android to be more customizable. Different launchers allow me to tailor my user experience and deep access to sharing tools and third party keyboards provide options not found on iOS.

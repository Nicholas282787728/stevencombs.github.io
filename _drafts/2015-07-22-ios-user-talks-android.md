Android has come a long way in the past several years and during that time, there has been a huge Hatfield and McCoy mentality between Android and iOS users. The only smart phone I have used is the iPhone. Since standing in line for that first version to my latest, the iPhone 5s, I've been firmly in the iOS camp. That has changed.

When Google announced [Project Fi][1], I became curious about [Android version 5.1 (Lollipop)][2], the [Motorola Nexus 6][3] and Google's new wireless network. I requested an invite to Project Fi and it arrived a month later. I immediately accepted and a few days later, the only phone available on that network, the Motorola Nexus 6 arrived on my door step. I've used the Nexus 6 for about six months. In December 2015, the phone was upgraded from Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop) to Android 6.0 and then 6.0.1 (Marshmallow).

Marshmallow brought stability and battery life to the Nexus. My experience with the phone led me to the purchase of an Android tablet. After much soul searching, and a budget of $200, I choose the nVidia Shield tablet K1. Designed for gaming, the tablet came with an 8” screen and some hefty processing power. It also came with the promise of an upgrade from Lollipop to Android. Upon turning the tablet on during Christmas day, the upgrade to 6.0 was available. I’m now waiting on the 6.0.1, but not in a rush.

After using these two devices extensively, I now have enough experience using android on two platforms (phone and tablet)  that I can now share my thoughts on the whole Android -vs- iOS debate. One caveat to keep in mind; I’ve tried not to spend too much time discussing hardware (save for battery) as this can differ greatly given the abundance of gadgets that run the Android operating system. I will focus on the operating system (Android -vs- iOS).

I’ve organized my thoughts into the following categories and you can use the table to contents below to jump to specific section:

1. [App availability][4]
2. [User interface (UI)][5]
3. [Customization][6]
3. [Launcher][7]
3. [Battery life][8]
4. [Hardware][9]
5. [Keyboard and mouse][10]
5. [Stability][11]
6. [Camera and photos][12]
7. [Podcasts][13]
8. [Mac syncing][14]
9. [Personal assistant][15]
10. [Conclusions][16]

# App availability
Years ago, I would have worried that the app I used on my iOS device would not be available on the [Google Play store][17]. I’ve not found this to be the case in 2016. There are a few iOS specific apps (Workflow, Reeder, etc) that are missing, but I have found adequate replacements.

Despite popular belief, Android apps are not all free. Many great apps require a pro activation. I’m okay with this as I don’t mind supporting great developers and the costs are always  minimal and comparable with the Apple App Store. There are also ways to get these pro activations for free. That’s for another post.

> **NEAT ANDROID FEATURE:** You can purchase an app on the Google Play store using your computer browser and after the purchase, direct the app to a specific device. Go to that device and the app will already be installed.

# User interface (UI)
Android versions prior to version 5.0 (Lollipop) were a mess. Versions after 5.0 include the [Google material design specification][18]. The Android UI is now modern, functional, bold, attractive, flat and colorful. Material design is also found in Chrome OS bringing consistency across the two platforms. This design specification is also applied to many Google online tools such as [Google Docs][19]. I've grown fond of material design. When I look over at my wife as she uses her iPad, it seems dull and dated. That is unless she loads a Google iOS app. Google is also applying this design specification to their iOS apps as well.

The only problem with material design is that many Android app developers are taking their time to adopt. Most popular apps I use have adopted the design specification, but many smaller titles haven't made the move making Google Play store a mishmash of app design. Over time this will hopefully improve and admittedly, I will not purchase an app now unless it does adhere to the specification.

Additionally, iOS app design is also a mixed bag. While many apps look great, they are not consistent in their UI design methodology and a feature in one app may not work the same in another. iOS 8 brought with it a new flatter design, but my preference is still Google's material design.

# Customization
If you are looking to customize your phone or tablet’s user interface, move widgets to any home screen, modify the status bar or even change the app icons, choose Android. Android allows so many customization options that it can at times be overwhelming. Having these options though allows each user to have an experience suited to their tastes and usage. If I were to compare customization on a scale of 1 to 10, iOS would be a 2 and Android would be an 11!

# Launcher
iOS forces you to use the Apple application launcher called Springboard. Android also includes a launcher and depending on the phone manufacturer, it may not the same. If you don’t like the current launcher on Android though, you can simply download another from the Google Play App store.

Currently I’m a fan of the [Google Now launcher][20] – Google’s own custom launcher that includes Google Now, Google Now cards and Google On Tap. This launcher provides voice commands (similar, but better than Siri) and contextual information based on the current time of day, your calendar and your search interests. It’s amazing how accurate Google Now cards has become at anticipating my digital assistant needs.

# Battery life
While Android shines in the sections above, Android battery life is definitely a negative. I have yet to own a device that can match an iOS device’s battery life; and it’s not even close. Android, even with the latest 6.0 that includes the Doze feature, can’t hold a candle to iOS devices.

An Android device can sit on the table, not being used, and the battery will drain like there’s a small leak in a balloon whereas an iOS device can sit on a table for days and barely lose a precent of battery life. I don’t understand it. When using an Android device, it becomes even worse. Both my Android phone and tablet are on daily charging cycles. My iPad air allowed me to go for days without charging and this included heavy daily use.

I’m sure battery life is device dependent and there may be an Android device that has battery life that can hold its own against an iOS device. If there is, I sure would like to know (leave a comment below).

# Hardware
This area is device specific. Unlike the iOS world, Google does not control the hardware except for their Nexus line. I use, and recommend the Nexus brand. Nexus devices have a pure Google Android experience and are normally the first to receive updates. I use the Nexus 6 on Google's Project Fi. I have an entirely pure Android experience from Google.

Motorola builds the Nexus 6 and includes the following:

* Wireless charging
* Dual front-facing stereo speakers (more immersive sound)
* 6" Quad HD display (2560x1440 AMOLED)
* Quick charge (6 hours of use from only 15 minutes of charge)
* Multi network SIM (utilize more than one service)
* 4K video camera

Newer Nexus devices include finger print scanners. Nexus hardware is now equivalent to most iOS devices and in some ways (wireless charging and AMOLED screens) surpasses Apple iOS devices. It appears that the only inequity between the latest iOS devices and the Nexus line is the [processor performance][21].

# Keyboard and mouse
Attach an external Bluetooth keyboard to a device running Android 6 and your fingers can fire off keyboard strokes and combinations that will make an iOS device cry. The ability to control Android with a keyboard is simply amazing. Here’s what you can do with an external keyboard:

* Take a screen capture with a single keystroke
* Activate the search field
* Navigate to application icons on the launcher using the arrow keys
* Another feature
* Another feature

Add a Bluetooth mouse to mix and you now have a pointer and almost pure desktop experience.

# Stability
Android, at least on the devices I use, still has several stability issues including:

* Tap and wait stuttering
* Bluetooth connectivity issues
* App crashes
* Camera not responding or slow to respond
* “Application not responding” errors

I won’t say these are constant issues, but that’s a problem too. There’s no way to troubleshoot the issues when they are random. Some days are worse than others. A reboot or a [cache partition wipe][22] will often correct. You will restart your Android device much more frequently that an iOS device to improve device stability.

# Camera and photos
The camera on my Nexus 6 is not nearly as good as the camera I had on my iPhone 5s. I do have to make sure conditions are just right in low light levels and the camera sometimes takes entirely to long to activate. I have missed a few good shots waiting for the camera. Android 6 has made the camera more responsive and has added a very nice feature - tap the power button twice and the camera loads immediately. No need to unlock the device. It's a great feature.

Android 6.0 also include the outstanding Google Photos app. Google Photos is a huge improvement over Apple Photos. Organization, sharing, editing, web access, search and collaboration are far better than the Apple alternative. One mind blowing feature is Google Photos search. Without any tagging on my part, I can search for say a "car" and Google Photos display my photos that include cars. It's amazing.

# Podcasts
Overcast was my go to Podcast app on iOS. On Android it took some time for me find a competent podcast client and I found it in Pocket Casts. Pocket Casts is very similar in function and design to Overcast. A plus for Android users who also use iOS devices, Pocket Casts is available and syncs between both platforms. Like Overcast, Pocket Casts includes a web based version so you can listen to podcasts using a browser. If you make the switch to Android and are a heavy podcast listener; no worries.

# Mac syncing
I worried that when I made the switch to Android, I would lose the ability to easily sync data between my Mac and my mobile device. There was no need to worry. Many solutions exist for seamless sync across devices. Below is a reference table that shows the data I sync and what tools I use:

| Data      | Mac Application | Android App  |
|:----------|:----------------|:-------------|
| Bookmarks | Chrome          | Chrome       |
| Contacts  | Contacts        | Contacts     |
| Calendar  | Calendar        | Calendar     |
| Documents | Google Drive    | Google Drive |
| Music     | iTunes          | iSyncr       |
| Notes     | Evernote App    | Evernote     |

# Personal assistant
I mentioned Google Now briefly in the [Launcher][23] section above. Google Now is the competitor to Apple's Sir, or [Amazon's Alexa](24). Activation is either through a tap of the microphone button or if configured, by the voice command, "Okay Google." My personal experiences have left me to prefer Google Now over Siri. Google Now is more accurate and provides many additional tools to control my Android device. I could write a whole post on the comparison between the two; however, for this post, I will simply state that Google Now is superior to Siri for my day-to-day workflow.

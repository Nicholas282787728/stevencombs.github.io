## Specifications

Before I share my thoughts about the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab with Google Assistant (whew!), let's find out what makes this thing tick and along the way, I'll share why it either a good thing, or maybe not so good:

### Device

We have the Yoga Smart Tab from Lenovo. The design, while still reminiscent of a tablet is unique due to the two powerful speakers built into the top, bottom, left of the tablet. We'll talk more about the speakers later. But at first glance, this is a tablet with a handle little stand and hanging stand! Really? I hanging stand.

### System

What OS powers this uniquely styled tablet? Android 9, affectionately know as Pie. The problem is, I've had enough Pie and there's no way to upgrade to Android 10 Q, or 11. This limits some things such as swipe to navigate gestures, complete dark mode integration and updated share sheets. It's not a deal breaker, but come-on Lenovo. You kill the users longevity and the tablet has the basic specs to run these later editions of Android. Thankfully, Lenovo is still concerned about security and security updates are still delivered. This seems to be on a quarterly schedule, not monthly like we find with Pixel devices. That's a shame.

### CPU

We talked about the OS, now let's talk tech and hardware. The Lenovo is powered by the now 3 year-old[Qualcomm Snapdragon 439](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-439-mobile-platform) 64 bit, 2 Ghz,  octo-core/thread processor. You would think with all that giga, octo, and thread count stuff, this would be a monster processor; however, online descriptions tout this chip as a "lower mainstream system on a chip (SOC)." In other words, don't expect amazing performance but just enough. And that's about right. The chip works fine for this device and most operations are smooth. App launching is tidy and multitasking is seamless. More on this as we talk about memory.

### GPU

Graphics are the work of the built-in Adreno 505. Again, three years-old and not what you would call a pixel pusher. It's fine for 2D display and minimal poly-count games, but try something like a modern shooter, and you will need to lower rendering requirements. I'm not a gamer, so for my use this is fine. On occasion, I will watch video on the device (especially since it has this amazing sound system - again, more on that later) and this chip will spit out 1080p video at 30 fps without hesitation. Again, not fabulous, but it gets the job done.

### Memory

Many low end tablets stick you with 2 Gb of on board RAM. Thankfully, Lenovo stepped this up and added an addition 2 Gb (for a total of 4 Gb) that helps the tablet perform admirably in my content consumption environment. I've never felt the tablet drag along (expect for one random app I'll share later.)

Internal storage comes from a suitable, but not massive, 64 Gb eMMC Flash Drive. About 50 Gb is available to the user. Add more storage (but no offloading of apps) using the microSD card expansion under the built-in stand. 64 Gb is plenty for my use, but you might need more if you want to carry around a bunch of video with you or play a lot of games, but remember that games gotcha!

### Battery

Battery life has been good to very good for my use case. My primary mode of operation for this tablet is in reading and video. I can easily get 10+ hours out of the Li-Po battery.

Fast charging is not supported on the included USB-C port. A full charge takes hours. Some say this is because the trickle charge is easier on the tablet's battery when the device in ambient mode. That may be true, but it sure would be nice to have the option to fast-charge; however, it's not been a showstopper for me.

## Other Thoughts

  1. 16:9 HD screen only but is crisp and clear
  2. Immediately connected to home Wi-Fi network and searched for updates
  3. Offered option to copy apps and data from another Device
  6. I was extremely pleased with the on-screen keyboard. The haptic feedback made typing on this device more intuitive than an iPad.
  7. I had to teach the tablet my voice again. I thought that odd as all other devices pull down my Google Assistant voice profile from the web.
  8. Here's a plus! The tablet includes Face Recognition to unlock. It uses a single image. It will be interesting to see how accurate it is in day-to-day use.
  9. Wants me to connect with a Lenovo ID. I created this account when purchasing the tablet from Lenovo so that was easy. Wonder what benefits come from this account?
  10. Now asking to install Outlook. Since I this app is on my Pixel 4 XL, why not!
  11. Ah, the Lenovo User Experience Program option to improve the product. I'm in and plan to provide lots of feedback.
  12. Get to select Gesture mode or Classic mode. Gesture it is to match the Pixel 4 XL user experience.
  13. Next I get to update and turn on Google Assistant's Ambient Mode (one of the key feature that made me purchase this device).
  14. A system update was available. Installation was FAST!

## Surprises

   1. Includes and FM radio but you need to use headphones as they act as the antenna.
   2. You have to "hard-activate" ambient mode using the Google Assistant settings. [Click here for instructions](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Smart-Tablets-with-Google/Yoga-Smart-Tab-Ambient-Mode-Introduction/td-p/4549840).
   3. Connect a keyboard and mouse to activate productivity mode.

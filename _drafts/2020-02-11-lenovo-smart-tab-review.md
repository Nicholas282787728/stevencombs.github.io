## Other Thoughts

  1. 16:9 HD screen only but is crisp and clear
  2. Immediately connected to home Wi-Fi network and searched for updates
  3. Offered option to copy apps and data from another Device
  6. I was extremely pleased with the on-screen keyboard. The haptic feedback made typing on this device more intuitive than an iPad.
  7. I had to teach the tablet my voice again. I thought that odd as all other devices pull down my Google Assistant voice profile from the web.
  8. Here's a plus! The tablet includes Face Recognition to unlock. It uses a single image. It will be interesting to see how accurate it is in day-to-day use.
  9. Wants me to connect with a Lenovo ID. I created this account when purchasing the tablet from Lenovo so that was easy. Wonder what benefits come from this account?
  10. Now asking to install Outlook. Since I this app is on my Pixel 4 XL, why not!
  11. Ah, the Lenovo User Experience Program option to improve the product. I'm in and plan to provide lots of feedback.
  12. Get to select Gesture mode or Classic mode. Gesture it is to match the Pixel 4 XL user experience.
  13. Next I get to update and turn on Google Assistant's Ambient Mode (one of the key feature that made me purchase this device).
  14. A system update was available. Installation was FAST!

## Surprises

   1. Includes and FM radio but you need to use headphones as they act as the antenna.
   2. You have to "hard-activate" ambient mode using the Google Assistant settings. [Click here for instructions](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Smart-Tablets-with-Google/Yoga-Smart-Tab-Ambient-Mode-Introduction/td-p/4549840).
   3. Connect a keyboard and mouse to activate productivity mode.

After a seven year affair with TiVo, I cancelled the account for our [Bolt](https://amzn.to/39wMQ6j). Unfortunately, it wasn't TiVo's fault but rather Comcast's. How you might ask? Because Comcast blew up our rate of $60 per month for Internet service and local channels - mind you, local channels only - to over $100! That's outrageous. No bit of negotiation would get the offer dropped. For the first time in three years, Comcast held firm on the new rate.

My option was of course to cancel my Comcast service; however, I must have Internet access, so I was able to get a rate of $70 for Internet only. Anyone see an issue here? That's right, $10 more for less! I did maintain the same online access speed, 200 Mbps. Which left me with a TiVo that no longer has access to any channels. So it was time to cancel that additional $13 per month. I thought this would be a hassel because in the past, TiVo required a phone call to cancel. Not any more. Visit your account, press a button, and "boom," account closed. Kudos to TiVo; which made my decision to cancel TiVo even harder.

The subsitute for the TiVo is YouTube TV. Even when we had local channels as part of our cable plan, we had a YouTube TV account. It has the channels we need, an amazing DVR capability, multiple accounts, and available on any device anywhere in the United State. I had been considering cancelling the TiVo access even before the rate hikes, but Comcast put the nail in the TiVo coffin. YouTube TV is everything we need in a television channel provider. Except for one thing. YouTube TV does not offer every channel available in my service area. Time to plug in an antenna to our television.

I've tried an indoor antenna from our home in the past and the reception was horrible. The antenna I tried about four years ago was an amplified model rated at fifty miles. In our area, the majority of stations are over sixty miles. When I cancelled the Comcast local service I began to research if indoor antenna technology had gotten any better. Apparently it has. When doing research I found the $27 model below on Amazon:

That's a mouthful! I read the reviews and most agree that it will receive channels from over sixty miles away with a 4.5 star rating but as they say, seeing is believing. In this post I am going to share my experience with this antenna and see if you can live in south-central Indiana and receive channels from both Indianapolis (55 miles away) and Louisville (70 miles away) with this indoor 130+ mile rated antenna.

## Opening the box

## Installation

## Channel scanning

### Short range

Auto program found 9 channels but when I tried to view them, they were horrible. Hiccups and stutters were the norm on every channel. No problem, I'll kick the receive up on long range. That will surely bring in the channels.

### Long range

Nope! That was even worse. In the same location and on long range, I was only able to pick up six channels and again, they were broken and pixelated. Relocating the antenna to different positions around the room didn't help either. Not that it would matter becasuse there is no way I would leave the antenna in some of the places I tried with a the cable strung across the room.

## Fine tuning

## Preformance

## Recommendation

This one is getting boxed up and sent back to Amazon. Seems the technology has not improved as much as they wanted me to believe and there is no way this antenna is rated at 130+ miles when I can't even pick up channels half the distance. Since I'm not inclined to install an external antenna, seems I will be watching what locals are available on YouTube TV.

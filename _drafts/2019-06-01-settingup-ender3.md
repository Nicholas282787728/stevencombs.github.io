In [my last post](linkhere) I journaled my experience assembling my new Creality Ender-3 3D printer. As I mentioned in that post, I have never created a 3D print and have no idea what to do first. Luckily, a [video from 3D Printing Canada](https://youtu.be/N9aWBjbj3Ag) was just what the doctor ordered.

I'll follow along with that video and prepare my printer for its first 3D print. Like my previous post, this will be in journal format.

## 00:22 Aligning the base
There was a fair amount of wobble in my 3D printer. The steps to loosen the base brackets worked for me and I only had to loosen and tighten the left bracket.

## 00:41 Tighten the x-axis gantry idler
The video says I should not be able to rotate the idler by hand. I can, so I need to tighten it per the instructions. In my case means rotating the nut counter-clockwise. About a quarter turn and the roller is perfect. I can't move it with my fingers and the gantry moves up and down smoothly.

## 00:47 Level the bed
This seems like a step I will need to do regularly so need to pay attention to this one. Need a business card or a post-it note. Now where can I find one of those? Alright, have a post-in note and needed to feed a pet. Now back to the video.

Turn the printer on. Got it. Select *Prepare* | *Auto home* on the controller. Place head at one corner of the bed on top of the adjustment. Should be able to move paper but with some slight resistant. Should not tear the paper. Now do the opposite corner. That took some time being it was the first time the bed was leveled and the first time I have done that. Still not sure its perfect, but will get better over time.

## 01:02 Install PLA filament
Select *Prepare* | *Move Axis* | *Move Z* | *40mm* on the controller.

Select *Prepare* | *Preheat PLA* | *Preheat PLA* on the controller.

Select *Control* | *Temperature* | *Nozzle:* | *200* on the controller.

Select *Control* | *Store settings* | and wait for beep. 

Wait for the temperature on the display to reach 200 degrees.

Cut filament at a 45 degree angle using cutters supplied with kit.

One day I'll write a post about my first experiences with Commodore computers. For now, I want to share my latest project; the conversion of a Commodore Plus/4 case and keyboard into what I am calling the Raspberry Pilus/4. This was not an overnight project and took some time to complete. The majority of the time was spent waiting for products to ship from Europe.

# Build List
1. [Commodore Plus/4 case with keyboard][1]
2. [TME DS1020-18RT1D - Connector: FFC (FPC); angled 90°; PIN:18][2]
3. [Individual Computers Keyrah V2][3]
4. [Raspberry Pi 4][4]
5. [Creatlity Ender-3 3D Printer][5]
6. [microSD Extender][]
7. [micro HDMI extender][]

# Software
1. [Sketchup on the Web][]
2. [Cura][]

I'm so excited to share this project and it is one that has been in the making for a couple of year now. Persistence was key to the completion of the this project.

# Secret Sauce - The Keyrah V2
While I appreciate Individual Computers’ production of the Keyrah V2, there are no detailed instructions for installation of the device into a Commodore Plus/4. While you can find projects that use the device inside other Commodore computers such as the C-64, VIC-20, and various AMIGA models, a little know addition to the Keyrah allows the use of the device inside a Plus/4 and a C-16. The instructions I provide will take some of the mystery out of this process.

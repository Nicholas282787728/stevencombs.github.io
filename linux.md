While I'm a huge [Apple fan](/apple.html), I also believe Linux to be a viable alternative for both new and old computers. As you will find below, I tend to try multiple distributions (versions) of Linux and have yet to settle on a single one. Thatâ€™s part of the fun.

Below are posts that share my tips or experiences with several flavors of Linux on several devices.

{% endfor %}
</ul>

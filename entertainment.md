Life isnâ€™t all work and hobbies. Occasionally I like to simply kick back and enjoy a book, movie or televisions show. On occasion I write or reminisce about  these entertainment options. I tend to gravitate toward science fiction, but also enjoy classics as well.

Below are my posts about books, movies and television.

{% endfor %}
</ul>

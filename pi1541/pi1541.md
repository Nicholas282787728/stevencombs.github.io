This is my resource page for the Pi1541. As I post information and videos about the device, I will post links here. This page will also contain general information about the device as well as tips, tricks, and usage.

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`⇪`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`⌃`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`⎋`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`⌂`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`⌫`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`⏎`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`⇧`  | Shift         |      |

## Links to Episodes

Below is a link to each blog post in the series. Each blog post contains the companion YouTube video and most include links to items or sites. This page captures a collection of all links mentioned.

1. [Pi1541 Assembly and First Use'](/pi1541-1)

    In the episode, I solder a pin connector onto the Raspberry Pi Zero, solder and assemble a serial cable with two 6 pin DIN connectors, assemble the whole package, and start up the Pi1541 for a first use. For some extra fun, be on the lookout for a cameo appearance from Nikki and a former vice president!

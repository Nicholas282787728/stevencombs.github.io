# <font color="orange">introduction to the echo</font>

I've referred to the Amazon echo as "[Siri in a Pingle Can][3ee33dfb]." It really is one of the best ways to describe not only the Echo's functions, but also its appearance. This tall cylinder sits on a counter, desk or dresser and provides quick access, via audio announcements, to news, weather, music and information. It does all of this using simple voice commands.

**<font color="#3498DB">NOTE:</font>** The Amazon Echo is only available, via waitlist and in limited supplies, to Amazon Prime members.

# <font color="orange">about this guide</font>

Much of the the content for this guide was originally found in [my review of the Amazon Echo][b9115e58]. As part of that review, I made a commitment to keep the page updated as new features were added to the Echo. Amazon rolls these features out on a regular basis and a I found that keeping the review up to date was a bit unwieldy and instead of providing additional useful information, the review became cluttered and more unorganized.

This page is my attempt to bring sanity to the review feature content by providing an entire list of commands in alphabetical order. It will be much easier to list a command, its function and any required setup in a table than to integrate this information within the confines of a review. This page will become a nice supplement to my review.

This page is an ongoing resource for readers and watchers of my Commodore Plus/4 series. I encourage you to contribute to this project by commenting on [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs) or on individual [blog posts](https://www.stevencombs.com/retro).

## User's Manual

In the Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 user's manual. I've scanned each chapter and provide those below. I will post new chapters with each new video.

1. [Front Matter](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-title-introduction.pdf)
2. [Chapter 1 - Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-1.pdf)
3. [Chapter 2 - Using the Keyboard and the Screen](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-2.pdf)
4. [Chapter 3 - Using Software](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-3.pdf)
5. [Chapter 4 - Getting Started](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-4.pdf)

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`⇪`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`⌃`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`⎋`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`⌂`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`⌫`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`⏎`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`⇧`  | Shift         |      |

## Links to Episodes

Below is a link to each blog post in the series. Each blog post contains the companion YouTube video and most include links to items or sites. This page captures a collection of all links mentioned.

1. [Commodore Plus/4 - Open the Box](/plus4-1)

    I share my first experience with a Commodore computer (it is not the Plus/4) and then we open the box on my eBay purchase.

2. [Commodore Plus/4 - Chapter 1, Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4-2)

    I open the Commodore Plus/4 manual for the first time and look at Chapter 1: Unpacking and Setting Up. Since the previous episode was an open the box, unpacking is already complete and this episode focuses on setting up the computer. Along the way I share a very cool tip.

    * [uxcell 6 pin connectors 4 pack](https://amzn.to/3fe4huQ)

    I talk about the keyboard layout, using the keyboard, and then how keyboard combinations affect screen elements. This is really a "hands on" episode!

    I cover each auxiliary storage device in detail; however, I add a modern spin and instead of the original devices; I use a new [264 diagnostic cartridge](https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/diag-264.html), a [Tapuino](https://www.stevencombs.com/tapuino-1), and a [Pi1541](https://www.stevencombs.com/pi1541-1).

## Supplemental Disk Image (Coming Soon)

As I progress through the user's manual, I enter and execute the sample programs. The .d64 image below contains every program from each episode.

retroCombs User's Manual Disk Image - Coming Soon

I use the following file name convention to make it easy for you to locate specific programs:

Sample Program Name: `CH1-PG25-RETROCOMBS.PRG`

`CH#` - where # is the chapter number
`PG#` - where # is the page number where the program is first referenced in the user's manual
`NAME` - my self assigned name for the program

## Supplemental Posts

The posts below are helpful for any Commodore 8-bit computer enthusiatsts but are also closely associated to this series and supplement the posts found above:

1. [retroCombs: Pi1541 Assembly and First Use](https://www.stevencombs.com/pi1541-1)

    In this supplemental episode to my Commodore Plus/4 series, I share my experiences assembling the Pi1541 Hat for a Raspberry Pi Zero. In the episode, I solder a pin connector onto the Raspberry Pi Zero, solder and assemble a serial cable with two 6 pin DIN connectors, assemble the whole package, and start up the Pi1541 for a first use.

2. [retroCombs: The Tapuino Project - Build an Arduino powered Commodore Datasette clone](https://www.stevencombs.com/tapuino-1)

    As part of my Commodore Plus/4 series, chapter three, of the user’s manual, includes a sections on using a datasette and a disk drive. In a previous post, I built the modern replacement for the disk drive (a Pi1541), now it’s time to create a datasette replacement called, the Tapuino.

## Plus/4 Resources

Below are links I've found to be most benefical as I work through this series:

1. [Commodore4Ever](https://commodore4ever.net/) - Source for Pi1451. Great customer service and feedback.
2. [The Future was 8-bit](https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/) - Source for parts and used to provide resources for the Tapuino project. U.K. based so allow some time for delivery if in the U.S.
3. [RETRO Innoviation](http://store.go4retro.com/) - Source for parts used for both the Tapuino and Pi1541 projects.
3. [Plus/4 World](http://www.plus4world.com/) - The most incredible source of Plus/4 information and software available. I don't know how the team does it, but if you have a Commodore C16, Plus/4, or 264, this is the site you must visit.

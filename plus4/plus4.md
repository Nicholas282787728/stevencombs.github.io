This page is a work in progress; however, it serves as a resource page for readers and watchers of my Commodore Plus/4 series. I encourage you to contribute to this project by commenting on [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs) or [blog posts](https://www.stevencombs.com/retro).

## User's Manual

As part of my Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 manual. I've also taken the time to scan and provides those below. I will release new chapters with each new video.

2. [Commodore Plus/4 - Chapter 1, Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4-2)

I open the Commodore Plus/4 manual for the first time to look at Chapter 1: Unpacking and Setting Up. Since the previous episode was an Open the Box, unpacking is already complete so this episode focuses on setting up the computer. Along the way I share a very cool tip.

This page is a work in progress; however, it serves as a resource page for readers and watchers of my Commodore Plus/4 series. I encourage you to contribute to this project by commenting on [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs) or [blog posts](https://www.stevencombs.com/retro).

## User's Manual

As part of my Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 manual. I've also taken the time to scan and provides those below. I will release new chapters with each new video.

1. [Front Matter](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-title-introduction.pdf)
2. [Chapter 1 - Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-1.pdf)
3. [Chapter 2 - Using the Keyboard and the Screen](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-2.pdf)

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`⇪`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`⌃`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`⎋`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`⌂`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`⌫`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`⏎`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`⇧`  | Shift         |      |

2. [Commodore Plus/4 - Chapter 1, Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4-2)

    I open the Commodore Plus/4 manual for the first time and look at Chapter 1: Unpacking and Setting Up. Since the previous episode was an open the box, unpacking is already complete and this episode focuses on setting up the computer. Along the way I share a very cool tip.

    I talk about the keyboard layout, using the keyboard, and then how keyboard combinations affect screen elements. This is really a "hands on" episode!

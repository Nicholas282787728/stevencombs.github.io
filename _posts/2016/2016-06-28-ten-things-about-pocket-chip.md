I've had some fun playing with the Pocket C.H.I.P. over the past week and while I do plan to write a full review, for now, I have ten things to share that might be of interest to new users of the the geekiest gadget I have ever owned.

![Pocket C.H.I.P.](http://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/pocket_chip.jpg)

## Number 1: A browser is built in

The Pocket C.H.I.P. has a built in browser called `surf`. 

**Try this:** in the *Terminal* type: 

`surf google.com` 

The Google search page will load. You will most likely have to scroll up/down and left/right to see the page. This is a very rudimentary browser with no user interface save for the scroll bars. In a pinch though, it could be very useful. To exit the browser, you return to the *Terminal* and use the ctrl + 'z' keyboard combination.

## Number 2: Use a Terminal browser

Download a *Terminal* text-based browser to provide quick access to information (sans graphics). A couple of my favorites include `w3m`, `lynx` and `elinks`. 

**Try this:** Install `elinks` using the following *Terminal* commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install elinks`
```

When the installation is complete **try this:** 

`elinks stevencombs.com`

The *Terminal* will display this site in all its text-based glory. Use the tab and arrow keys to navigate.

## Number 3: Help is available 

There is an excellent online bulletin board system (BBS) full of users and Next Computing staff to provide assistance and support. It is located at <https://bbs.nextthing.co/>. The community is quick to answer questions. Be sure to search the BBS before you post a question. You will most likely find an answer immediately. Before heading to the BBS though, review the documentation at: 

<http://docs.getchip.com/pocketchip.html>

> The BBS community has been instrumental into the quality and accuracy of this post. Be sure to see the bonus "things to know" at the bottom of this post. Many "things to know" were provided by this group and I update this post frequently based on their suggestions. You may want to return in a day or two to see what I add.

## Number 4: Use the app switcher

Do not hit the home button to get back to other apps or the *Terminal*. The included task switcher will cycle through running applications. Use the following keyboard combination to switch applications:

`ctrl` + `tab`

## Number 5: It's a really tiny screen 

Not all software will display properly on the small LCD screen and you may not be able to access all UI elements. There is no pinch and zoom currently and this is likely not an option. One option would be to have a utility that will scale the screen in some way so as to access all controls. Keeping my fingers crossed that some enterprising developer will find a way to take care of this.

## Number 6: Calibrate the touch screen 

If your resistive touch screen (not capacitance like screens found on tablets and phones) is giving you fits, you can calibrate it using these instructions: 

<http://www.chip-community.org/index.php/Troubleshooting#Calibrating_Touchscreen_on_PocketChip>

## Number 7: Play retro style games and learn to program

Pico 8 is a fabulous app that not only let's you play retro style games, but also learn/teach basic programming skills using the Lua programming language. Check out these excellent resources to get started: 

<https://github.com/felipebueno/awesome-PICO-8>

## Number 8: Use Pocket C.H.I.P. as a calculator

Use the included Python programming language as a built in calculator. 

**Try This:** in the *Terminal* type: 

`python` 

The python prompt will appear. Type:

`2+2` followed by the return (â†©) key

Python will display the sum. To exit the Python interpreter, type:

`ctrl` + `z` 

Check out the resource below for additional calculator functions: 

<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html>

For a more traditional calculator, **try this:**

In the *Terminal* type:

`xcalc`

Your Pocket C.H.I.P. is now an old school basic functions calculator as shown in the image below. This application makes great use of the Pocket C.H.I.P.'s touch screen. Thanks to [midheaventech](https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/10-things-the-new-pocket-c-h-i-p-owner-should-know/5724/12?u=stevencombs).

## Number 9: Use a full-size keyboard

The [Logitech K400 keyboard](http://amzn.to/29loNc3) is an awesome external keyboard not only for a Raspberry Pi, but also the Pocket C.H.I.P. Plug the dongle into the USB port to make Pico 8 programming easier with the tiny little screen.

## Number 10: Control the Pocket C.H.I.P. from a computer

Don't purchase an external keyboard. Control your Pocket C.H.I.P. using your computer keyboard and trackpad/mouse. Follow my [Raspberry Pi `x11vnc` instructions](http://www.stevencombs.com/raspberrypi/2016/03/24/mirror-raspi-monitor-on-mac.html). They work just as well on the C.H.I.P.

## Bonus: Star Wars

Watch the original Star Wars story unfold on your Pocket C.H.I.P. **Try this:** in the Terminal type: `sudo apt-get update`, followed by `sudo apt-get install telnet` followed by `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`. Use ctrl + 'j' to close the telnet session and ctrl + 'l' to clear the *Terminal*.

## Bonus tips from the Pocket C.H.I.P. community

### Customize the home screen: (ejamer from the BBS)

You can modify the default home screen icons and launcher. Use the visual instructions found at:

<http://imgur.com/gallery/J8Tqo>

Be advised that this is still a bit of a hack. Next Thing is working on an official implementation.

### Add a speaker: (bmjohnsn from the BBS)

It would appear at first blush that the Pocket C.H.I.P. requires headphones for sound; however, with [this clever little soldering hack](https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/add-a-speaker-to-pocketc-h-i-p-in-less-than-20-minutes/4511), you can add a small 3 watt amp and speaker (or two for stereo) to the inside of the Pocket C.H.I.P. case. This is another hack and it requires some soldering skill; however, it is way cool and a project on my list of things to do (or possibly a variation).

### Emulate games: (bmjohnsn from the BBS)

bmjohnsn recommends this Nintendo-centric retro gaming link:

https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/mednafen-emulator-configuration-gbc-gba-snes-nes/5027

However, I'm more of an 80s gaming retro fan and am anxiously awaiting [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) support for Commodore computing. How awesome would that be?

## Did I miss anything?

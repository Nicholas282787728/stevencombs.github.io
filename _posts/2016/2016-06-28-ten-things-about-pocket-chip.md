I've had some fun playing with the Pocket C.H.I.P. over the past week and while I do plan to write a full review, for now, I have ten things to share that might be of interest to new users of the the geekiest gadget I have ever owned.

![Pocket C.H.I.P.](http://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/pocket_chip.jpg)

## Number 1: A browser is built in

The Pocket C.H.I.P. has a built in browser called `surf`. **Try this:** in the *Terminal* type: `surf google.com` and hit the return key. The Google search page will load. You will most likely have to scroll up/down and left/right to see the page. This is a very rudimentary browser with no user interface save for the scroll bars. In a pinch though, it could be very useful. To exit the browser, you return to the *Terminal* and use the ctrl + 'z' keyboard combination.

## Number 2: Use a Terminal browser

Download a *Terminal* text-based browser to provide quick access to information (sans graphics). A couple of my favorites include `w3m`, `lynx` and `elinks`. **Try this:** Install `elinks` using the following *Terminal* commands, `sudo apt-get update` followed by `sudo apt-get install elinks`. When the installation is complete, **Try this:** `elinks stevencombs.com` and see this site in all its text-based glory. Use the tab and arrow keys to navigate.

## Number 3: Help is available 

There is an excellent online bulletin board system (BBS) full of users and Next Computing staff to provide assistance and support. It is located at <https://bbs.nextthing.co/>. The community is quick to answer questions. Be sure to search the BBS before you post a question. You will most likely find an answer immediately. Before heading to the BBS though, review the documentation at: <http://docs.getchip.com/pocketchip.html>

## Number 4: Use the app switcher

Do not hit the home button to get back to other apps or the *Terminal*. The included task switcher, ctrl + tab, will cycle through running applications.

## Number 5: It's a really tiny screen 

Not all software will display properly on the small LCD screen and you may not be able to access all UI elements. There is no pinch and zoom currently. Keeping my fingers that this will be addressed by someone soon.

## Number 6: Calibrate the touch screen 

If your resistive touch screen (not capacitance like screens found on tablets and phones) is giving you fits, you can calibrate it using these instructions: <http://www.chip-community.org/index.php/Troubleshooting#Calibrating_Touchscreen_on_PocketChip>

## Number 7: Play retro style games and learn to program

Pico 8 is a fabulous app that not only let's you play retro style games, but also teach basic programming skills using the Lua programming language. Check out these excellent resources to get started: <https://github.com/felipebueno/awesome-PICO-8>

## Number 8: Use Pocket C.H.I.P. as a calculator

Use the included Python programming language as a built in calculator. **Try This:** in the *Terminal* type: `python` and the python prompt will appear. Type `2+2` followed by the return (â†©) key. Python will display the sum. Type ctrl + `z` to exit the Python interpreter. Check out this resource for additional calculator functions: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html>

## Number 9: Use a full-size keyboard

The [Logitech K400 keyboard](http://amzn.to/29loNc3) is an awesome external keyboard not only for a Raspberry Pi, but also the Pocket C.H.I.P. Plug the dongle into the USB port to make Pico 8 programming and use much more computer like, but with a tiny little screen.

## Number 10: Control the Pocket C.H.I.P. from a computer

Don't want to purchase an external keyboard? Control your Pocket C.H.I.P. using your computer keyboard and trackpad/mouse. Follow my [Raspberry Pi `x11vnc` instructions](http://www.stevencombs.com/raspberrypi/2016/03/24/mirror-raspi-monitor-on-mac.html). They work just as well on the C.H.I.P.

## Bonus: Star Wars

Watch the original Star Wars story unfold on your Pocket C.H.I.P. **Try this:** in the Terminal type: `sudo apt-get update`, followed by `sudo apt-get install telnet` followed by `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`. Use ctrl + 'j' to close the telnet session and ctrl + 'l' to clear the *Terminal*.

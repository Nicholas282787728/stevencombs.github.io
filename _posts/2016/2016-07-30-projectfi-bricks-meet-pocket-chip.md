In November of 2015, [Project Fi][1] (Google’s mobile phone service), sent out *Happy Holidays* kits to their users. The kit included Project Fi building bricks. Many online inaccurately called them LEGO bricks despite the face that they are definitely not LEGO brand. You can tell because they have “fi” on the stud and the quality of each brick is not up to LEGO manufacturing standards.

The *Happy Holidays* kit was a followup to the [Project Fi welcome kits][2] that were sent out to early adopters of Project Fi. The intent of the *Happy Holidays* kit is to build a stand for a Nexus 6 phone, the only phone available on Project Fi at that time. You can see their design in the image below.

I could never bring myself to break open the pack. I really didn’t need a stand for my Nexus 6 so the kit remained on my shelf until today. I was sitting at my desk and trying out a [Logitech K400 plus keyboard][3] with my Pocket C.H.I.P. Normally I place a pencil in one of the provided holes to support the Pocket C.H.I.P. in a vertical position. On this day I couldn’t find a pencil in my office. Instead, I stumbled upon the Project Fi *Happy Holidays* kit. I had a few minutes and wondered if I could quickly build a stand for my Pocket C.H.I.P. 

For the first time, I broke open the bag of bricks and began building. To my surprise, I was able to quickly create a stand for my Pocket C.H.I.P. that was both functional and good looking. Well, as good looking as you can make with the bricks and colors provided. Without further ado, I present what I call my Pocket C.H.I.P. Building Brick Dock.

Below you will find an image gallery with descriptions beneath each image. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them at the end of the post.

The Pocket C.H.I.P. Building Brick Dock complete with a [Logitech Keyboard][4] and a [Music Bullet portable speaker][5]. Yes, that's a C.H.I.P. to the left.

Front view with Pocket C.H.I.P. firmly in place and balanced nicely so it does not tip forward or backward.

Side view of my stair-step design. The bricks provided do not allow many design options.

In this image you can see the back of the dock as well as “fi” on the top of each stud. Color variations in the bricks provide a bit of visual interest.

Leaning the Pocket C.H.I.P. forward a bit, you can see how I use angled bricks and a flat plat with the S.N.O.T. (studs not on top) technique to create a flat resting service for the back of the Pocket C.H.I.P.

I slide the Pocket C.H.I.P. into the dock. I was surprised how close the width tolerance of the Pocket C.H.I.P. was to my design. It really does fit like a glove. Made me wonder if the folks at Next Thing Co. were LEGO fans and actually made the width specifically for this type application.

I built in an integrated V shape to provide access to, and visually point out, the home/power button.

<br /><div style="background-color: white; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; min-width: 0px; width: 653px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">{Note: This is a repost of an older blog that I am shutting down. It seemed appropriate to add this post here as an educational experience for all who may be in or considering the situation described.}</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">My daughter maintains her own blog (like daddy, like daughter) called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.katherinecombs.com/">Katt@Blogger</a>. Recently&nbsp;<a href="http://www.katherinecombs.com/2011/07/some-things-never-change.html">she wrote a piece</a>&nbsp;that really touched me, or rather hit me like an M1A1 main battle tank running through a brick wall. Here’s the general thesis:&nbsp;<i>being the child of divorced parents sucks!</i>&nbsp;She’s actually a much more talented writer than that quote may reveal. Heck, she’s a much better writer than I am. So check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.katherinecombs.com/2011/07/some-things-never-change.html">her post</a>&nbsp;and then come back and hit the link below to read my response.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /><a name='more'></a>Katherine wrote the piece because when we were coming to the end of one of our daddy/daughter weeks. It is always hard for both of us, but ultimately I know it is always harder for her, as her blog post painfully reinforced. I left a comment in response and I thought I would share it here:</div><blockquote><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">It’s not any easier for the parent. Trust me. I too am sad when I have to leave you and/or your brother. It has not been easy and is not a situation I would recommend to anyone. Parents take note: divorces and broken families stink. It may sound easy to opt out of a relationship, but strongly consider the impact your future will have on your children. As Katherine has suggested above, “it sucks" for the child. I don't care how “mature”&nbsp;or “put together”&nbsp;you think they are.&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">On the other hand, I can attest I have the best daughter in the world and when we do get just daddy/daughter time, it is wonderful! You have grown into a beautiful woman with talents that far exceed my own. Watching you grow and mature is exciting and scary at the same time. I only hope you can break the chain of divorce that has plagued our family.</div></blockquote><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">This blog post is not a response as much as it is an emotional outlet for me. I stand by my comments and would once again send a plea to parents considering divorce. Work thought it. I don't care what the issue. Don’t be selfish. Make a change that will change your children’s lives. I know wherefore I speak regarding this divorce thing and as my daughter has so&nbsp;eloquently&nbsp;put it,&nbsp;<i>it sucks!</i></div></div>

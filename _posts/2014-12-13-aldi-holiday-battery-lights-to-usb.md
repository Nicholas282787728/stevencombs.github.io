Nikki purchased me a set of ALDI holiday lights a couple of weeks ago. I believe they were around $8.00. They run on two AA batteries (3v) and can switch between off, constantly on or blinking. Although the batteries have yet to die, my goal was to provide power via a USB port (5v) on my Macs or [Chromebook](http://www.stevencombs.com/chrome.html). You've probably seen USB light sets for sale at Target and Walgreens and they usually cost around $15 to $20.

This was an extremely easy hack. I started with one of seven old Apple 30 pin dock connector cables (who needs that many 30 pin dock connector cables!?!). I cut off the 30 pin connector and stripped back the wires. Luckily, the wires were color coded. Red for positive (pin 1) and black for negative (pin 4) connections. A volt/ohm meter verified my connections and power signal. You can find more information about the USB connector [here](http://pinouts.ru/Slots/usb_pinout.shtml)

I opened the battery compartment, removed the batteries and soldered the positive (red) and negative (black) wires to the battery connectors. Next I routed the cable back through the switch opening. Surprisingly, there was plenty of room. Finally, I put the battery compartment cover back on and flipped the switch. All the lights fired up and there was no smoke. Success! I believe the whole process took me all of about 15 minutes and that includes heating up the soldering iron.

Below is a video of the results.

This was a VERY simple hack that anyone with basic soldering skills can perform. Now I can enjoy the lights of Christmas while chugging away on my Mac.

It’s been a gadget kind of weekend. Yesterday I shared an [unboxing of a new Baofeng GT-3 radio](http://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2015/02/14/beofeng-gt3-unboxing.html) and today I had time to unbox a new gadget that arrived last week from China – the [SYMA X5C-1 Quadcopter](http://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters/pp_73260.html#vip=15513).

The SYMA X5C-1 is a radio controlled quadcopter noted for:

* low cost – around $50
* excellent reviews
* inside and outside flight
* flight stability
* low learning curve
* six axis stabilization system
* 360° flips
* HD camera

I made my [purchase from GearBest](http://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters/pp_73260.html#vip=15513). Shipped directly from China, it took about 3 weeks to arrive and required a trip to the post office for a signature (thanks Nikki!). Since arriving, I’ve had a chance to open up the box, try a few flights, and make a video. This thing is a blast to fly, although practice is required, and a whole bunch of fun. Well worth the [$50](http://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters/pp_73260.html#vip=15513). I look forward to warmer weather for outside flights and further testing.

For now, enjoy my unboxing gallery below to find out what’s in the box as well as read a few observations.

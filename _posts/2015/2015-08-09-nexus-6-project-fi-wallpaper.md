I've been on the hunt for wallpaper for my Nexus 6 Project Fi phone. There are very few available and my preference is to highlight the Fi logo and add a touch of material design to match Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Below is my first design.

# <font color="red">The wallpaper Google should have provided for your Project Fi Nexus 6!</font>

This first image is what the wallpaper looks like on my phone.

You can download this next image to your Nexus 6.

I have ideas for other versions and when I create them, I will post them here. If you have an idea for a design or a variation, post a comment below and let me know.

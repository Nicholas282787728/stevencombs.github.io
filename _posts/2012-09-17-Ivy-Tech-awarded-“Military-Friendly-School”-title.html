As a retired military member myself, I am very proud of this award to our regional campus.<br /><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ac-DK-XtThA/UFdiVoEtBCI/AAAAAAABB9g/V1kDz6JDLVA/s1600/VA+Logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ac-DK-XtThA/UFdiVoEtBCI/AAAAAAABB9g/V1kDz6JDLVA/s200/VA+Logo.png" width="200" /></a><blockquote>Ivy Tech Community College – Columbus/Franklin has been named to the “Military Friendly Schools” list by Victory Media Inc., a service-disabled, veteran-owned business founded in 2001, which publishes its lists in national and local periodicals.  This list honors the top 15 percent of colleges, universities, and trade schools in the nation that are doing the most to embrace America’s military service members, veterans, and spouses as students and to ensure their success on campus.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“Inclusion on the 2013 list of Military Friendly Schools shows Ivy Tech’s commitment to providing a supportive environment for military students,” said Sean Collins, vice president of Victory Media.  “We’re thrilled to provide the military community with transparent, world-class resources to assist in their search for schools,” he said.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The Military Friendly Schools media and website, found at <a href="http://www.militaryfriendlyschools.com/">www.militaryfriendlyschools.com</a>, feature the list, interactive tools, and search functionality to help military students find the best school to suit their unique needs and preferences.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“We are pleased to be counted among the schools that will be recommended to the military community through Victory Media,” said Pat Vercauteren, Ivy Tech military support coordinator and a veteran, himself.  “We do all that we can to help our service members in their academic careers.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>In October, a full story and detailed list of 2013 Military Friendly Schools will be highlighted in the annual G.I. Jobs Guide to Military Friendly Schools, distributed in print and digital format to hundreds of thousands of active and former military personnel.  The Guide and associate media will also be featured at the Carrier Classic college basketball game on November 9 between Ohio State and Marquette on the deck of the USS Yorktown.</blockquote>Congratulations to our Student Affairs Team!&nbsp;</div>

It’s been about a month since the [unboxing](http://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2015/02/03/amazon-echo-unboxing.html) of our new [Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/oc/echo/ref_=ods_dp_ae). Since the unboxing, we’ve put the Echo through its paces and it's finally time to provide a review of this music playing, information delivering device. If you aren’t familiar with the Amazon Echo, watch the video below before you read the rest of the post.

<hr>

{**Update: April 5th, 2015**} As the Echo continues to receive upgrades, I will add them to this review. Updates will receive the same marker that appears before this paragraph. A list of updates appears below.

**Updates:**

* April 5th, 2015 - Echo receives Pandora support

Once I had the Echo unboxed, I placed Echo on the table where I unpacked it and plugged it into a 110v outlet (required). Initial tests were conducted in this location. I would quickly learn that this was not to be the permanent home for the Echo.

# Location, Location, Location
I moved the Echo four times before it landed in a spot where it would be used on a regular basis. My home office desk was the Echo’s first home. This was a horrible location. My computer provided all the capabilities of the Echo. Speaking to obtain music and information was of no value and superfluous. Additionally, the [Alesis monitors](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F3F7OIS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00F3F7OIS&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20&linkId=FLW6FCSHU4ACYWHF) provide much better sound than the Echo. Time to try another location.

The second location chosen was the living room. I had hopes of more use in this location. Again, the device was duplicative because the living room already had a Sonos and television with an [Amazon Fire TV](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CX5P8FC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CX5P8FC&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20). No one was asking the Echo to help them with anything. If it was used, it was purely as a novelty or to quickly check the weather.

The third location was the kitchen, which is adjacent to our living room. Once again, this was a bad spot. It became an expensive oven timer. It was time to try yet another room; however, I was running out of public locations. Then it dawned on me. Maybe a public space was not the answer.

I moved the Echo to what would be its final resting place; the bathroom. We have a unique bathroom feature. Between our master bedroom and bathroom, we have a built in coffee bar. Our [Keurig coffee maker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000AQSMPO&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20) is on the coffee bar. One morning while brewing a cup of coffee it hit me, “This is the perfect spot for the Amazon Echo!” I was correct. From this location, we can control the Echo from the bathroom, bedroom and our walk-in closet. We even noticed, by accident mind you while discussing the Echo, that if we directed our voice, we could even issue commands from our Kitchen and laundry room.

![My Amazon Echo Location](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tkL-ylfSL0k/VOjFGbNKvmI/AAAAAAABZws/PQSY9tn4isI/w1214-h911-no/IMG_7192.jpeg)

I knew I found the perfect location when I came home one evening and heard my wife using the Echo. She had not used it in any other room in the house. So now that you know the location of our Echo, let me share how we use it.

# Alexa!
As shown in the video, you use a *wake* word to activate the Echo. Currently you have two options:

* Alexa
* Amazon

I was surprised to learn “Echo” wasn’t an option; after all, that’s the name of the device. We choose to stick with Alexa. Amazon just didn’t ring for us.

To initiate a command, we say (or in some cases yell), “Alexa.” followed by a request. Once you say Alexa, the top of the Echo will light up as shown in the image below.

![Wake up Echo](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bvIm4JdHqH0/VOjEj7NSsrI/AAAAAAABZxM/5Ck31N8Ycl0/s988-no/IMG_7194.jpeg)

I have to admit, the light ring is pretty spectacular and a great visual cue. I initially made the mistake of thinking you had to wait for the light to continue a command. You don’t. Just say the entire request slowly.

For instance you can say:

“Alexa, what time is it?”
or
“Alexa, what’s the weather for tomorrow?”

I would previously say:

“Alexa [one one thousand, two one thousand], what time is is?”

Echo has a good track record. If no music is playing and I am within about 20 feet, Echo has about 100% accuracy. Now that’s not to say that Echo’s response is 100%, just that the Echo heard my command and translated was able to translate my voice to text. You may or may not get the response you expected. As you would suspect, accuracy decreases with distance or when there are loud background noises.

How do I know when the Echo heard me correctly? Amazon provides an [Amazon Echo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-echo/id944011620?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l9vL) iOS app to provide a history of requests. With the app, you can verify that Echo heard you correctly, as shown in the image below.

![Amazon Echo app speech accuracy](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MJMwQcXc3ok/VOjEjsbgs1I/AAAAAAABZvA/RHwPCWzIMwI/w557-h988-no/IMG_7191.png)

This is the way Amazon obtains feedback to increase Echo accuracy. The app is also a great way to initiate a command using your iOS device rather than voice. I won’t spend time discussing the iOS app. It does the things you would expect.

Like most voice controlled devices, user training is still a requirement. No voice controlled system perfectly parses your request every time. It really is up to you to figure out what Echo needs to hear to make things happen. This is most noticeable when you request music.

# Time to face the music
Echo provides music using three services, [Amazon Prime Music](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8335758011), [iHeartRadio](http://www.iheart.com/) and [TuneIn Radio](http://tunein.com/). Since access to on demand music is a key feature of the Echo, let’s take a look at these services.

## Amazon Prime Music
To listen to Amazon Prime Music, you must first be an [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBYBNEE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DBYBNEE&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20) member (currently $99). We are subscribers and if you own an Echo, you will want to be. Many people are unaware that Amazon Prime not only provides free two-day shipping, but also access to video content (Amazon originals, movies and television), the Kindle lending library, photo storage and free music.

Echo uses the Amazon Prime music service to provide access to thousands of free songs. Want to listen to songs by Boston? Say:

“Alexa, play Amazon Prime band Boston.”

Alexa will shuffle the artist’s music. This is great if you know what artists are available. In order to find out, you will need to browse Amazon Prime music in your browser. You can’t ask Echo to list music available. Your request for an artist or song will be a shot in the dark, which can lead to some interesting results.

Requests by music genre have been hit or miss for me; although, I have been successful recently with requests for “classic rock” and “heavy metal.” The music I receive is a curated playlist of songs from the genre. If I move to another genre and back again, the same songs from the original playlist are frequently repeated. There’s not a lot of variety. Additional playlists are available; however, to play them, you must know the exact playlist title. The command below would be useful.

“Alexa, list classic rock playlists.”

If you store music you own in the Amazon Cloud or have made music purchases via Amazon, you can access your songs and albums using the Echo. I was able to listen to purchased albums; however, I have a mix of music from sources such as: ripped CDs, Google Play, Amazon and iTunes. In order to use Echo, I have to upload every song to Amazon. This will require me to pay extra for cloud storage. I am not going to do this. I can listen to my music collection on my [Sonos](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005441AJC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005441AJC&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20) without a additional cost.

Frankly, I’m not that interested in storing music in the cloud anymore. I like to be surprised by the next song and to discover new and old favorites. That’s where services such as [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) shine; however, Pandora is not an option. Thankfully iHeartRadio is.

## iHeartRadio
Admittedly, before the Echo arrived, I was unfamiliar with [iHeartRadio](http://www.iheart.com/); however, after using it with the Echo, I’ve become a fan. I’ve even added the service to my Sonos and downloaded the [iHeartRadio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iheartradio-stream-best-music/id290638154?mt=8) app on my iOS devices.

iHeartRadio usage is similar to Pandora. You search for an artist or a song and iHeartRadio will build a station around that selection. The key to successful use of iHeartRadio with Echo is to create an iHeartRadio account online, create/save stations, rate music, and then ensure you give your stations names you can remember. Echo, frustratingly, cannot list your saved stations.

While listening to an iHeartRadio station, I can even customize stations using the command:

“Alexa, [thumbs up/thumbs down].”

iHeartRadio also provides access to local radio stations. I believe TuneIn Radio, more later, provides better access to terrestrial radio streams; however, I can see the appeal of using a single service to provide access to both custom and local stations.

To tune to an iHeartRadio station (either live or custom) you simply say:

“Alexa, iHeartRadio station [station name].”

The Echo Light Ring will swirl and within a second or two the Echo will play the requested station; sometimes. Again, you have to know the station name exactly. If you deviate from the station name one iota, all bets, and music, are off. Echo owners will want to create an iHeartRadio account and give it a try. I currently prefer using iHeartRadio over the Amazon Prime Music service.

## {Update: April 5th, 2015} Pandora Radio
Last week Amazon made the announcement that the Echo now supports Pandora Radio. Use of Pandora Radio is identifical to iHeartRadio save for the service command. For instance:

“Alexa, Pandora station [station name].”

My Pandora stations all start with a sequential number before the descriptive station name. I was surprised when the Echo was able to start my radio station named `02 | Hair Bands` with a simple:

“Alexa, Pandora station 02.”

I did not have to vocalize the entire station name. This makes it quick and simple to play my Pandora stations. Similar to iHeartRadio, you can also thumbs up and thumbs down your music to tailor your station.

Echo will allow you to create a new Pandora station with the command:

“Alexa, Pandora artist [artist name].”

or...

“Alexa, Pandora song [song name].”

Echo will then ask if you want to add this station to your Pandora Radio list before playing. You won't be able to modify your station name or content using the Echo, but its a great way to create a new station.

## TuneIn Radio
I’ve been a [TuneIn Radio](http://tunein.com/) user for many years. TuneIn Radio's main focus is to provide access to to terrestrial radio but it also provides access to podcasts. If you want to listen to podcasts on the Echo, you will use TuneIn Radio. I haven’t tried this as my podcast listening only occurs during my run or while traveling.

While you need an account to iHeartRadio, strangely, an account to TuneIn Radio does not matter. While this might be fine for those who don’t use the service regularly, those of us with accounts can’t access our favorites. It doesn’t matter though because tuning to a radio station is as simple as knowing the station call letters.

“Alexa, TuneIn Radio station WWWY.”

This command instructs Echo to tune to my local classic rock channel. You can try to tune in using a station’s title or tagline; however, I found this hit or miss. Echo is always spot on when you use the call sign. Once you have music playing, you will want to control it.

# Crank it up
Echo provides hands-free control of the music, which is why the bathroom is a great location. While in the shower, I can say things like:

“Alexa, turn up the volume.”

or

“Alexa, volume [number between 0 and 10].”

Echo will also *pause*, *stop*, *play*, and jump to the *next* song. One of my favorite features while a song is playing is to ask questions such as:

“Alexa, what song is this?”

or

“Alexa, what album is this song from?”

You can even follow up with questions about the band or the artist and Echo will read you a portion of a Wikipedia entry. I’ve used this several times when a song is playing and I can’t remember the name of the song, artist or the album. You actually can learn a lot about your music using this feature.

# Your personal news and weather personality
Echo also makes it easy to access the latest weather and news. If I want to know what to wear to work in the morning I can ask:

“Alexa, what’s today’s weather?”

or

“Alexa, what’s the temperature?”

or

“Alexa, is it going to snow today?”

While shaving or waking up on a lazy Saturday morning, I can say:

“Alexa, news.”

Alexa will play the latest NPR and/or BBC hourly update on TuneIn Radio. Using the iOS app, as shown below, I can choose additional news items for Echo to play or read to me.

![Echo news selection](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8YhzpSKZADM/VOjIQuaLiHI/AAAAAAABZw0/hqvsMfZIQb8/w557-h988-no/IMG_7195.png)

Did I mention that the bathroom location is the best spot in the house for our Echo?

# Make time for Echo
Echo is a great clock even though it doesn’t have a display. You can use echo to set an alarm, timer or simply request the time. I often find myself asking Echo to tell me the time with a simple:

“Alexa, what time is it?”

Setting a timer or alarm is easy and convenient. When you set a timer, you can even ask:

“Alexa, how much time is left?”

Echo will happily tell you the remaining time. Echo really is the best clock, without a display, that I have every used.

# Echo odds and ends
What I describe above are the key features of the echo; however there are a many other things you can do. In the list below, from the [Amazon Echo Ask Questions page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201549800), you will find additional commands. What they do should speak (or read) for themselves.

* “Alexa, who is [name]?”
* “Alexa, when is [holiday]?”
* “Alexa, when did [historical event] happen?”
* “Alexa, who starred in the movie [movie title]?”
* “Alexa, how do you spell [word]?”
* “Alexa, what is [number] plus [number]?”
* “Alexa, what is the distance between [location] and [location]?”
* “Alexa, what time is it in [city]?”
* “Alexa, tell me a joke.”

You can even use Echo to keep you organized with the following:

* “Alexa, add milk to my shopping list.”
* “Alexa, put mowing on my to-do list.”

These items will be placed in the Amazon Echo app for review. You can even ask Echo to tell you what items are on your lists.

The Echo is also a Bluetooth speaker. You can pair your iOS device (“Alexa, pair Bluetooth.”) and stream audio to the Echo. You can then listen to other services not available on the Echo such as Pandora, Spotify or Overcast. You won’t be able to use Echo voice control but the Echo does make a pretty decent sounding Bluetooth speaker.

# Remote? We don’t need no stinkin’ remote.
Seriously, I’m not sure why a remote is included in the package. Our is in its magnetic cradle attached to my iMac. I’ve yet to use it and personally think using it would take away the magic. There may be instances where the remote and its built-in microphone are useful, but I’ve yet to find one. Drop me a comment below if you are Echo user who has found a use for the remote.

# Echo gets smarter
Since my purchase, I’ve received a one email to inform me of new voice commands. Below is an excerpt from that email.

> Echo's also quite the movie buff. Have some fun testing out its responses to classic movie quotes. A few to try:
>
> From Jerry McGuire: "Alexa, Show me the money!"
> From Wayne's World: "Alexa, Party on, Wayne."
> From Airplane: "Alexa, Surely, you can't be serious."
> From A Few Good Men: "Alexa, I want the truth."

You can predict the response from Echo. Now obviously these are just fun commands; however, it does at least demonstrate that the Echo’s cloud brain can learn new tricks. Let’s hope future updates provide more useful commands; which leads me to my wish list.

# Wish I may, wish I might…
While I do use the Amazon Echo regularly, there are several features I recommend. I’ll list each one and provide a bit of narrative.

**Shopping** - For the life of me I don’t understand why I can’t purchase items beyond digital music from my Echo. I can’t even price check an item or hear more about a product. This seems like a natural fit for the Echo. Its Amazon after all! This would be a great feature for items you purchase regularly such as batteries, kitchen products, etc.

**Digital display** - I mentioned earlier that the Echo doesn’t have a display; however if it did, I could finally tell the time at night without calling out a name and waking up my wife. The addition of the outside temperature as well as what’s currently playing would also be useful. I get that Amazon wants the echo to be a voice/audio gadget, but sometimes you really need a display.

**Control FireTV** - Imagine a day when I could use the Echo to control my [Amazon Fire TV](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CX5P8FC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CX5P8FC&linkCode=as2&tag=bricinmypockb-20). I could have Echo find content to play, pause my movies and even tell me more about what’s playing. This integration would begin to bring Amazon into the connected home category.

**Multiple Echo Connections** - I’m stealing this feature from Sonos. The ability to connect two or more Echo’s throughout the home will allow me to control music throughout our home. From any Echo, I could control music, play the same music on all devices or cause different content to play in different rooms.

**Enhanced Sound Quality** - Amazon Echo sound isn’t bad, especially for a bathroom radio; however, if you want a true music lover to take this thing seriously, you need better sound and a way to connect two to create a stereo field (once again, a feature stolen from Sonos). Even a simple speaker/microphone only unit would suffice. This would also allow you to extend the vocal receive range of your base unit throughout your home at a cheaper cost.

**Additional Music Services** - Echo needs access to additional services such as Spotify, Pandora and SiriusXM streaming. It would also be nice, as mentioned earlier, to be able to stream my own personal music from a server on my network. I get that Amazon wants to push their music service and I can live with the excellent services the Echo currently includes; however, for mass adoption, I think Amazon will need to branch out and offer additional services as they do on their Fire TV.

**Calendar and Email Access** - As part of my morning ritual, I want to ask Echo to tell my about my daily activities or to read email. Add this feature and you have a device that makes you more productive. Add the ability to respond to or create an email and we have a game changer. Especially if I can send email to control [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) recipes. While I’m at it, IFTTT integration alone is a game changer.

**String commands** -  There are times when I have music or news playing and I want to interrupt Echo with a question. Sometimes Echo will know to return to my music and sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes when a request is made, the content will continue in the background. I want to string commands together so Echo knows exactly what I want to do. For instance:

“Alexa, Pause, thumbs up, play.”

Normally, the Echo will continue to play music at a reduced volume while it executes the command, causing me to miss a part of the song. Stringing commands together will explicitly tell Echo my preference. Stringing commands will also reduce the need for multiple commands in the morning. Imagine this command:

“Alexa, tell me the weather, today’s schedule, the news and when the time is 7:30am.”

The Echo could then keep me informed through the morning and ensure I am on time for work.

That’s a pretty tall order for a first generation device that even Amazon Prime customers can’t purchase for another 3-4 months; however Amazon touts this thing as a device that will continue to get smarter and smarter, so save for the hardware modifications, these aren’t unreasonable requests.

# The final verdict
I really like our Echo despite the occasional hiccup. It does duplicate the features of other devices, but it also trumps other devices in many ways. After all, I’m not going to use Siri in the shower and Echo sound quality is far superior to my iPhone.

The Echo is a fine gadget and does all things advertised. Given time and a couple of strong cloud updates, the Echo will become more useful and a better value. Part of the fun of Echo ownership is learning what new features Amazon adds.

If you are considering an Echo purchase, you have to ask yourself, “Are the Echo features worth $200?” That’s a personal question you have to answer yourself. If you have $200 burning a hole in your pocket, probably. It's a fun device and you could spend much more on other gadgets that do less. If you can grab an Echo at the limited time Amazon Prime rate of $99, I highly recommend a purchase. No matter how much you spend on the Echo, you will only be satisfied if you force yourself to use it on a regular basis, which we have done. Ours is used everyday due to; location, location, location!

More updates are on the way and we should probably look at the Echo again in a year. It might be fun to make a now-versus-then comparison. Until then, drop your comments and questions below.

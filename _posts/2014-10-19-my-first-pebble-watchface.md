I’ve been playing with [my new Pebble]() and one of the first things I wanted to do was create a unique watchface with my college’s, [Ivy Tech Community College](http://www.ivytech.edu), brand. I found a site that made this quick and easy:

[Watchface Generator for Pebble](http://www.watchface-generator.de/)

Below is a screenshot of my first watchface (it looks much better on the watch). View this page on your iPhone and then touch the image to download if you want to wear your Ivy Tech Community College pride on your Pebble watch.

The site uses a simple point and click interface to quickly create a new watchface. My future goal is to learn more about Pebble watchface development so I can include an image refinement, control more of the layout/design and display a weather report. To do this, I must first work my way through [several tutorials](http://developer.getpebble.com/getting-started/watchface-tutorial/part1.html).

Let me know if you download the watchface by dropping a comment below.

Inside Indiana has just posted that the Ivy Tech Corporate College&nbsp;(the non-credit side of the college) will offer the <a href="http://www.msscusa.org/" target="_blank">Manufacturing Skill Standards Certification</a> to active-duty military who are soon to begin their transition from military to civilian.<br /><br />The certification will assist in the acquisition of jobs in manufacturing and logistics. Read the entire story <a href="http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=54561&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IIB-Headlines+%28Headlines+-+Inside+INdiana+Business+with+Gerry+Dick%29">here</a>&nbsp;to learn more and to find out which campus locations will offer this program. I am happy to report that our campus is on this list.

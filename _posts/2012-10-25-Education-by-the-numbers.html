Almost every professional document I read, or meeting I attend, contains some percentage, amount, cost or goal. Some of them are redundant and insignificant while others I find interesting or valuable.<br /><br />Let me present the most interesting numbers that have presented themselves to me in the past couple of days.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">You can view the numbers and a few sources after hitting the link below.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><a name='more'></a><ul><li><strong>1000</strong>: The goal our Chancellor has identified as the total number of student who transfer from our institution to a four-year institution by 2015. Great goal and hope we can reach this one. We have several initiatives in the hopper and hope to blog about some of these soon.</li><li><strong>17.83%</strong>: The decrease in our region’s student FTE from this same time last year (after we drop non-pays/attends). This is significant and is the cause of many of our <a href="http://www.stevencombs.com/2012/07/hard-budget-times-are-not-necessarily.html">financial challenges</a>.</li><li><strong>$380,000</strong>: The cost to remodel the President’s Office at Purdue University.<sup>1</sup> No wonder the community college is the most affordable higher education in the state.</li><li><strong>$1.7 billion</strong>: Total 2012–13 Indiana state appropriations for higher education. <sup>2</sup> An increase of <strong>.03%</strong>. As our President put it today, the budget is <em>flatlined</em> from last year.</li><li><strong>6%:</strong> Percentage of the $1.7 billion that will be distributed among those colleges and universities that meet certain performance goals. No, I have not seen these goals yet, but will be researching very soon.</li><li><strong>488,964</strong>: Number of K–12 students in Indiana on free or reduced lunches. <sup>3</sup></li></ul>That’s almost 50% of the students.Those are just few numbers that were discussed today during a recent regional academic officer’s meeting. There were others, as I found while perusing my notes, but these were the digits I found most interesting, striking, confusing or worrisome. I’ll keep my eyes open in the future for other numbers and when I do find more of interest, I’ll try and remember to consolidate them and add to a future post.<br /><br />Do these numbers mean anything to you?

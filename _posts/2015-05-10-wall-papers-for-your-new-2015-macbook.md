The new early 2015 MacBook is the best portable Mac I've ever owned and I've owned several (PowerBook G4, White MacBook, MacBook Pro and MacBook Air). When I reviewed the desktop backgrounds included with Yosemite, I did not find any that highlight the new design and colors (I have gold). I decided to create a few backgrounds and share them with other new MacBook owners. Below is the first available for download. More to come.

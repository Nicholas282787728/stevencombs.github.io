I created the video below (several years ago in fact) to demonstrate how to create a clipped viewport in  LayOut, the companion layout software for SketchUp Pro. The clipped viewport option allows you to create an other than rectangular shaped viewport. In my video, I show you how to create a circular viewport to highlight a specific feature on a model.

I hope that helps someone as I found it a bit tricky and not at all intuitive; however, when you learn how to use this feature, you can create some amazing layouts for your models ready for print or electronic distribution.

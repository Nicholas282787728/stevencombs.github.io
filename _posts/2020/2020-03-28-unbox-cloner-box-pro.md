Time to open the box on a [ClonerAlliance HDML-Cloner Box Pro](https://amzn.to/2UMUOCd); a device that promises to be the one device to capture them (video that is) all. Not a full review, just a quick YouTube video to show what's inside the box and talk about how I plan to use the device. I'll do my best to follow up with a full review later.

The YouTube video, _OPEN THE BOX: ClonerAlliance HDML-Cloner Box Pro_, is below:

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">

</div>

Not only do I take the Cloner Box Pro out of it's box, I also take a look at the design, features, and cables included. I even call an HDMI cable a USB cable. What fun and be on the lookout for pop-up error corrections!

I hope to do the following things with the Cloner Box Pro:

* Capture Chrome OS live to OBS Studio
* Record Chrome OS tutorials
* Capture video device menus (Roku and Android TV)
* Capture retro computer screens (Commodore 64, VIC-20, etc)

I'll run the device through its paces and I hope to capture my experiences in a future video. As a side note, I'm learning to use the free [DaVinci Resolve version 16.2](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/). Amazing video editing software and I don't know how or why it is free! There will probably more information on that side project in the future (or not; who knows) as well.

Drop a comment below and let me know if you use a [ClonerAlliance HDML-Cloner Box Pro](https://amzn.to/2UMUOCd). I'd love to hear from folks who use it in creative ways and with OSB Studio (if that is possible).

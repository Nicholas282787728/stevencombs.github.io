I posted an "open-OPEN the- box"BOX video for the Lenovo Smart Tab with Google Assistant. In the video, I make mention of a follow-up video review. MI was surprised how many folks called m ee out for not producing this follow up video so I decided to provide my review as a blog post. You can check out the video in question below and afterward, read my reviein a blog post. This is that blog post. If you've not seen the video, check it out below.

## YouTube Video: _OPEN THE BOX: Lenovo YOGA TAB with Google Assistant_

In the video below, I open the box on a Lenovo Yoga Tab with Google Assistant:

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hu-KtK3lYzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></p></div>

Now that you've seen the offending video, below are my thoughts and a final review.

## Specifications

Before I share my thoughts about the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab with Google Assistant (whew!), let's find out what makes this thing tick and along the way, I'll share why it is either  good, or thin, or mae no so good.

By the way, if you need a case for this device, I found this $12 MoKo case really works well and it comes in several colors. I chose boring black.:

### Device

The design, while still reminiscent of a tablet, is unique due to the two small, but powerful speakers built into the top, bottom, left of the tablet. We'll talk more about the speakers later. But at first glance, this is a tablet with a book spine and a built in metal stand that you can use to hang the tablet! on a hook!handle little stand and hanging stand! Really? I hanging stand.

### System

What OS powers this uniquely styled tablet? Android 9, affectionately know as Pie, is the OS for this device.. The problem is, I've had enough Pie and there's no way to upgrade to Android 10 Q, or 11. This limits device featuresome things such as swipe gestures, complete dark mode integration, and updated share sheets. It's not a deal breaker, but come-on, Lenovo. You kill the user's tablet longevity. T and the devicetablet has the specs necessarybasic specs to run these later verseditions of Android. Thankfully, Lenovo is still concerned about security and security updates are still delivered on what appear. This seems to be on a quarterly schedule;, not monthly like we find with Pixel devices.

### CPU

Let's talkWe talked about the OS, now let's talk tech and hardware. The Lenovo is powered by the now 3 year-old [Qualcomm Snapdragon 439](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-439-mobile-platform) 64 bit, 2 Ghz,  octo-core/thread processor. You would think with all that giga, octo, and thread count stuff, this would be a monster processor; however, online descriptions tout this chip as a "lower mainstream system on a chip (SOC)." In other words, don't expect amazing performance but "just enough." And that's about right. The chip iworks fine for this device and most operations are smooth. App launching is tidy and multitasking is seamless. More on this as we talk about memory.

Graphics are the work of the built-in Adreno 505. Again, three years-old and not what you would call a pixel pusher. It's fine for 2D display and minimal poly-count games, but try something like a modern shooter, and you will need to lower rendering requirements. I'm not a hardcore gamer, so for my use this is fine. On occasion, I will watch video on the device (especially since it has this amazing sound system â€”- again, more on that later) and this chip will spit out 1080p video at 30 fps without hesitation. NAgain, not fabulous, but it gets the job done.

### Memory

Many low end tablets stick you with 2 Gb of on board RAM. Thankfully, Lenovo stepped this up and added an additional 2 Gb (for a total of 4 Gb) that helps the tablet perform admirably in my content consumption environment. I've never felt the tablet drag along.

![microSD card location](/images/posts/lenovo/microSD.gif (expect for one random app I'll share later.)

Internal storage comes from a suitable, but not massive, 64 Gb eMMC Flash Drive. About 50 Gb is available to the user. Add more storage (but no offloading of apps) using the microSD card expansion under the built-in stand (see video above). 64 Gb is plenty for my use, but you might need more if you want to carry around a bunch of video with you or play a lot of games, but remember that games gotcha!

### Battery

Battery life is good. My primary usehas been good to very good for my use case. My primary mode of operation for this tablet is in reading and video. I can easily get 10+ hours out of the Li-Po battery.

Fast charging is not supported on the included USB-C port. A full charge takes several hours. Some say this is because the trickle charge is easier on the tablet's battery when the device in ambient mode. That may be true, but it sure would be nice to have the option to fast-charge; however, it's not been a showstopper for me.

### Display

Technically, the display is HD but it is a few pixels short at 1920 x 1200, versus 1920 x 1280; however, it's a beautiful 10" IPS LCD screen with a 60 Hz refresh rate. HDR is not supported but colors are bright and blacks are dark. There has not been an environmental situation that has caused me any issues with the screen. I do have to admit, I don't use the tablet outside often and when I am in the sun, I'm a vampire, so I use it in the shade or under and outdoor covering. Don't think I've ever used it in direct sunlight.

### Camera

Camera quality is good but not; n. Not great or near the quality you would expect on a modern phone. TI've always thought taking ayour tablet out to take pictures, to me, is was a bit goofy and cumbersome. T, so this is not an issue for me. Besides, the front camera is "good enough" for a Zoom or Teams meeting.

### Sensors

Holy tricorder, Mr. Spock (how about that mashed up of two 70'slike the way I mashed up a couple of pop culture references?). This thing has 28 sensors that cover both internal and external environmental variables. Why it has a step sensor is beyond me. It's not as if you are going to strap this thing on your back and go for a hike. My guess;, is it's leftover remnants from the mobile processor which helps toagain explains why Android on tablets is such a mess. On the plus side, this thing includes any sensor necessary to make light gaming a pleasure.

### Ports

The tablet includes both headphone and USB-C ports. The hHeadphone port works as expected. The USB-C port provides all the I/O features and also charging; however, charging is trickle and not high speed. Someone explained to me that the rational for trickle was the tablet's use of Ambient mode (when it acts like a Home Hub). In this mode, the tablet remains plugged in and trickle charge is easier on the battery and provides longer life. Good guess and. I'll go with that for now.

## What's to like

Okay, let's sum it all up and talk about what I like about this tablet.

1. Form factor iwas just what I was looking for in a tablet.
2. Price. You can grab this thing for around $200. Now that may seem like a lot of money when you compare with a Kindle Fire; however, with the Lenovo, you get the full Google Play Store eExperience, Home Hub features, and the Google Assistant.
3. NoSound. I've never heard any Android tablet sound this good. Kick on Dolby and those two tiny speakers really belt out the sound. Great for watching your favorite online video or YouTube music video.
4. I also like how the speakers create a kind of faux spine for this tablet making it feel more like I'm holding a book when reading.
5..
5. Not sure why, but I really like the built-in stand. You obviously need it for ambient mode; however, it comes in handy when you just want to set the tablet up on a desk or table to keep an eye on email or when you want to pair a keyboard and mouse and use the tablet like a PC notebook.
6. I'm extremely pleased with the on-screen keyboard. The haptic feedback made typing on this device more intuitive than an iPad.
7. Here's a plus! The tablet includes fFace rRecognition to unlock and it works really well. Not sure how secure it is, but the tablet never leaves home so it sure beats pounding in a PIN.
8. It includes an FM radio! Yes, and old fashioned, tune the dial, FM radio. You must plug in a set of headphones to the headphone jack so it has an antenna, but it works amazingly well with the included FM radio application.

## What's a not to like

There's a lot to like, but the tablet also has a few drawbacks.

1. No Android 9. No upgrades. Android 9That's as far as she goes. What a waste. While security updates continue about every quarter, it sure would be nice if to move to 10 or now, 11. The tablet can handle the upgrades, why not provide them?
2. Don't purchase this tablet if you are into hardcore gaming. You will not like the experience. Casual gaming is great though.
3. No fast charging; however, see my notes above and in reality, it's not that big a deal.
4. If you want a tablet that's as flat as a 15th century earth, this form factor ain't it.
5. Not all Android apps are optimized for tablets. Some don't rotate or scale properly and some just don't work period. This is where Apple has a leg up on Android. Apple'sTheir curated tablet store ensures an excellent level of app quality whether on phone or tablet. Google really needs to get their act together in this space if they ever want to compete with Apple in the tablet space. I don't think they do. I think we will soon see Chrome OS as the predominant tablet OS. Heck, I'm writing this blog post on the ultimate Chrome OS tablet, a Pixel Slate.
6. Skip the built-in Lenovo Launcher and use a third party. I like the [Rootless Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=amirz.rootless.nexuslauncher). It doesn't pack a bunch of features, but does a great job mimicking the Pixel Launcher which keeps things consistent across my tablet and my Pixel phones.

## Final Thoughts

The Lenovo is a 2019 product andtablet and is over a year old now and as such is beginning to show its age in 2020. I believe this will be my last Android tablet. I plana newer replacement, the 

## Surprises

1. Includes and FM radio but you need to use the device for the remainder of the year, but can see myself upgrading to another device, say a Chrome OS tablet like a second generation [Lenovo Duetadphones as they act as the antenna.

2. You have to "hard-activate" ambient mode using the Google Assistant settings. [Click here for instructions](https://wwwforums.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/student-chromebooks/Lenovo-CT-X636/p/ZZICZCTCT1X) in 2021.

While I like Android as a phone OS, I just can't get over the limitations of Android on a tablet and as Google continues to build in Android and Google Play features into Chrome OS, a device like the Duet just seems to make a lot more sense. Chrome OS devices as it will receive regular updates; run Android apps, run Linux apps, can have a tablet formfactor, and can be used as a full fledge computerlike this device.

If you can find this tablet on sale for less than $200, grab it. If you understand the limitations I share, I think you will have a pleasurable experience.

There; I've lived up to my video promise by providing a full review. I hope readers and YouTube watchers find this review helpful.t5/Lenovo-Smart-Tablets-with-Google/Yoga-Smart-Tab-Ambient-Mode-Introduction/td-p/4549840).

Burning the contents of an [.iso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.iso) file should be a relatively intuitive and error free process; however, people often make a simple critical mistake. View my popular video below that demonstrates how to use the [Burn application](http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html) to transfer the contents of an .iso file correctly to a CD.

This is by far the easiest method to create a [Live CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD) using a Mac. If you need to transfer the contents to a USB drive instead of a CD, check out [this post](http://www.stevencombs.com/apple/2009/05/27/create-bootable-usb-drive-osx.html).

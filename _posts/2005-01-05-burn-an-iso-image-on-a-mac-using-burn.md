What should be a relatively intuitive process, can often waste several CDs. View my very popular video below that demonstrates how to use the [Burn application](http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html) to transfer the contents of an .iso file correctly to a CD.

This is by far the easiest method to create a LiveCD using a Mac. If you need to transfer the contents to a USB drive instead of a CD, check out [this post](http://www.stevencombs.com/apple/2009/05/27/create-bootable-usb-drive-osx.html).

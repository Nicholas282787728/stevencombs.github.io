## Sorry this page does not exist. =( Bummer, huh?

Oh well, give it another shot. Click something on this page. Who knows what might happen next! If you are lucky, elephants in tutus might appear and perform a couple of scenes from Star Wars.

Speaking Star Wars, did you know you can watch a version of the film by typing the command below in the linux or OS X terminal?

`telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`

Even on my 404 page you learn something cool.

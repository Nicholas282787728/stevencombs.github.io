<h1 class="title">Thanksgiving, community colleges, and changing lives</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>This is the first Thanksgiving in my new role as Vice Chancellor for
Academic Affairs. While reflecting on this yesterday, I decided to send
out the following e-mail to all of the faculty within our region:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Faculty,</p>

  <p>Before you head off for the Thanksgiving holiday, I wanted to let you
know how much I appreciate everything you do for our students. For
some this is a very difficult time of year and this can hold
especially true for our students as they struggle their multiple
commitments. What often happens though, is that we sometimes forget to
recognize those co-workers around us who struggle as well. If you know
of someone within your academic area who needs support, I do hope you
will reach out to them this holiday season.</p>

  <p>So what am I thankful for? Being a part of this campus and having the
opportunity to serve each of you as we strive to change the lives of
our students. Thank you for letting me (sic) a part of your team.</p>

  <p>Steven</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally I struggle when sending out mass email to faculty. I consider
whether the message is relevant, beneficial, and/or productive. Once I
write a message, I often go over it numerous times as I know that the
English faculty are out there picking it apart for grammatical and
spelling errors. I come from an industrial background and do not have
what I would call, exceptional writing skills, as is evident by my
exclusion of word in the last line. On this occasion though, I didn’t
want my message to seem contrived, but rather heart felt. I decided to
stream of conscious this one and just let it flow.</p>

<p>Feedback from the faculty has been positive, but my absolute favorite of
the bunch was from a faculty member who mentioned that they decided to
go to a food bank to make a donation after they read my message. When
they spent time talking with folks, they found out that several of our
students were recipients of these donations. That’s what community
college service is all about folks. Changing lives and making a
difference. To all of my fellow community college faculty, staff and
administrators:</p>
<h3>Happy
Thanksgiving!</h3>

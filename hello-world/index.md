title: “So many ‘Hello Worlds,’ so many languages”

**This page is in draft form.**

<!-- Convert to Blog Post -->
As an amateur coder, I often dabble in multiple languages such as Ruby, C, Arduino, Java, etc. Each language has a unique structure and specific syntax requirements (add a semi-colon at the end anyone?). 

To help jog my memory, I thought it would be beneficial for me to create a page that demonstrates the same program in multiple languages. This can serve as a primer to each language as well as a comparison. I will stick to modern languages and am likely to add more in the future. The list below contains the first languages I will work through.

If you are looking for an app to try out various languages, might I suggest [CodeRunner](!mas). It’s available in the Mac app store and is my go to app when I want to try out a snippet of code.

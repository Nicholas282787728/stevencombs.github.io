As an amateur coder, I often dabble in multiple languages such as Ruby, C, Arduino, Java, etc. Each language has a unique structure and specific syntax requirements (add a semi-colon at the end anyone?). 

To help jog my memory, I thought it would be beneficial for me to create a page that demonstrates the same program in multiple languages. This can serve as a primer to each language as well as a comparison. I will stick to modern languages and am likely to add more in the future. The list below contains the first languages I will work through.

If you are looking for an app to try out various languages, might I suggest [CodeRunner][1]. It’s available in the Mac app store and is my go to app when I want to try out a snippet of code.

# Preparation
Many programmers create an outline of a program before they type a single line of code. This sometimes takes the form of either [pseudo code](!wiki) or a [flow chart](!wiki). I will present both, but before doing so, I will also provide a description of the program in paragraph form.

## Description of the code

	program name
	program language
	program author
	
define import function
	import system information

define input function
	request first and last name separated by a space
	request two numbers separated by a space
	
define data processing function
	separate name into two variables named fname & lname
	separate numbers into two variables named n1 & n2
	determine if first number is greater than the second

define output function
	print ('hello ' + person)
	print ('you are running python version ' + sys.version)
	print date and time
	print blank line
	print first number is greater or less than second number
	print the sum the two numbers
	print the multiplication of the two numbers
	print the larger number minus the smaller number

define loop
	do the following ten times
		print line number value
		print “hello world!”
		add one to line number value
	end the loop
```

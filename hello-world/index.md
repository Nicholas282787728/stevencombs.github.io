As an amateur coder, I often dabble in multiple languages such as Ruby, C, Arduino, Java, etc. Each language has a unique structure and specific syntax requirements (add a semi-colon at the end anyone?). 

To help jog my memory, I thought it would be beneficial for me to create a page that demonstrates the same program in multiple languages. This can serve as a primer to each language as well as a comparison. I will stick to modern languages and am likely to add more in the future. The list below contains the first languages I will work through.

If you are looking for an app to try out various languages, might I suggest [CodeRunner](!mas). It’s available in the Mac app store and is my go to app when I want to try out a snippet of code.

# Preparation
Many programmers create an outline of a program before they type a single line of code. This sometimes takes the form of either [pseudo code](!wiki) or a [flow chart](!wiki). I will present both, but before doing so, I will also provide a description of the program in paragraph form.

## Description of the code
This program will...

## Pseudo Code
Pseudo code is a program outline that does not include any programming language specific code but is rather a line-by-line description in plain english. I find it useful to copy the actual outline and paste it into the my [integrated development environment](!wiki) (IDE) or program editor. After I paste, I convert each line to a comment. A good IDE, such as [Atom](!g) or [Sublime Text 3](!s), will provide a tool to do this automatically. This creates an outline for my work and ensures I don’t miss a step. This is the same technique to use when you create an essay from an outline.

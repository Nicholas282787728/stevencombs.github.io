title: “So many ‘Hello Worlds,’ so many languages”

As an amateur coder, I often dabble in multiple languages such as Ruby, C, Arduino, Java, etc. Each language has a unique structure and specific syntax requirements (a semi-colon at the end anyone?). 

To help jog my memory, I thought it would be beneficial for me to create a page that demonstrates the same program in multiple languages.
